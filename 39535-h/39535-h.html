        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having in the last
        chapter given a brief, but I trust not altogether indistinct, account
        of the causes that ensured the triumph of Christianity in Rome, and
        of the character of the opposition it overcame, I proceed to examine
        the nature of the moral ideal the new religion introduced, and also
        the methods by which it attempted to realise it. And at the very
        outset of this enquiry it is necessary to guard against a serious
        error. It is common with many persons to establish a comparison
        between Christianity and Paganism, by placing the teaching of the
        Christians in juxtaposition with corresponding passages from the
        writings of Marcus Aurelius or Seneca, and to regard the superiority
        of the Christian over the philosophical teaching as a complete
        measure of the moral advance that was effected by Christianity. But a
        moment's reflection is sufficient to display the injustice of such a
        conclusion. The ethics of Paganism were part of a philosophy. The
        ethics of Christianity were part of a religion. The first were the
        speculations of a few highly cultivated individuals <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and neither had nor could have had any
        direct influence upon the masses of mankind. The second were
        indissolubly connected with the worship, hopes, and fears of a vast
        religious system, that acts at least as powerfully on the most
        ignorant as on the most educated. The chief objects of Pagan
        religions were to foretell the future, to explain the universe, to
        avert calamity, to obtain the assistance of the gods. They contained
        no instruments of moral teaching analogous to our institution of
        preaching, or to the moral preparation for the reception of the
        sacrament, or to confession, or to the reading of the Bible, or to
        religious education, or to united prayer for spiritual benefits. To
        make men virtuous was no more the function of the priest than of the
        physician. On the other hand, the philosophic expositions of duty
        were wholly unconnected with the religious ceremonies of the temple.
        To amalgamate these two spheres, to incorporate moral culture with
        religion, and thus to enlist in behalf of the former that desire to
        enter, by means of ceremonial observances, into direct communication
        with Heaven, which experience has shown to be one of the most
        universal and powerful passions of mankind, was among the most
        important achievements of Christianity. Something had, no doubt, been
        already attempted in this direction. Philosophy, in the hands of the
        rhetoricians, had become more popular. The Pythagoreans enjoined
        religious ceremonies for the purpose of purifying the mind, and
        expiatory rites were common, especially in the Oriental religions.
        But it was the distinguishing characteristic of Christianity that its
        moral influence was not indirect, casual, remote, or spasmodic.
        Unlike all Pagan religions, it made moral teaching a main function of
        its clergy, moral discipline the leading object of its services,
        moral dispositions the necessary condition of the due performance of
        its rites. By the pulpit, by its ceremonies, by all the agencies of
        power it possessed, it laboured systematically and perseveringly for
        the regeneration of mankind. Under its influence, doctrines
        concerning the nature <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg
        003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        God, the immortality of the soul, and the duties of man, which the
        noblest intellects of antiquity could barely grasp, have become the
        truisms of the village school, the proverbs of the cottage and of the
        alley.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But neither the
        beauty of its sacred writings, nor the perfection of its religious
        services, could have achieved this great result without the
        introduction of new motives to virtue. These may be either interested
        or disinterested, and in both spheres the influence of Christianity
        was very great. In the first, it effected a complete revolution by
        its teaching concerning the future world and concerning the nature of
        sin. The doctrine of a future life was far too vague among the Pagans
        to exercise any powerful general influence, and among the
        philosophers who clung to it most ardently it was regarded solely in
        the light of a consolation. Christianity made it a deterrent
        influence of the strongest kind. In addition to the doctrines of
        eternal suffering, and the lost condition of the human race, the
        notion of a minute personal retribution must be regarded as
        profoundly original. That the commission of great crimes, or the
        omission of great duties, may be expiated hereafter, was indeed an
        idea familiar to the Pagans, though it exercised little influence
        over their lives, and seldom or never produced, even in the case of
        the worst criminals, those scenes of deathbed repentance which are so
        conspicuous in Christian biographies. But the Christian notion of the
        enormity of little sins, the belief that all the details of life will
        be scrutinised hereafter, that weaknesses of character and petty
        infractions of duty, of which the historian and the biographer take
        no note, which have no perceptible influence upon society, and which
        scarcely elicit a comment among mankind, may be made the grounds of
        eternal condemnation beyond the grave, was altogether unknown to the
        ancients, and, at a time when it possessed all the freshness of
        novelty, it was well fitted to transform the character. The eye of
        the Pagan philosopher was ever fixed <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> upon virtue, the eye of the Christian teacher
        upon sin. They first sought to amend men by extolling the beauty of
        holiness; the second by awakening the sentiment of remorse. Each
        method had its excellences and its defects. Philosophy was admirably
        fitted to dignify and ennoble, but altogether impotent to regenerate,
        mankind. It did much to encourage virtue, but little or nothing to
        restrain vice. A relish or taste for virtue was formed and
        cultivated, which attracted many to its practice; but in this, as in
        the case of all our other higher tastes, a nature that was once
        thoroughly vitiated became altogether incapable of appreciating it,
        and the transformation of such a nature, which was continually
        effected by Christianity, was confessedly beyond the power of
        philosophy.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href=
        "#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
        Experience has abundantly shown that men who are wholly insensible to
        the beauty and dignity of virtue, can be convulsed by the fear of
        judgment, can be even awakened to such a genuine remorse for sin as
        to reverse the current of their dispositions, detach them from the
        most inveterate habits, and renew the whole tenor of their lives.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the habit of

        contributed much to the regenerating efficacy of Christian teaching,
        has not been without its disadvantages. Habitually measuring
        character by its aberrations, theologians, in their estimates of
        those strong and passionate natures in which great virtues are
        balanced by great failings, have usually fallen into a signal
        injustice, which is the more inexcusable, because in their own
        writings the Psalms of David are a conspicuous proof of what a noble,
        tender, and passionate nature could survive, even in an adulterer and
        a murderer. Partly, too, through this habit of operating through the
        sense of sin, and partly from a desire to show that man is in an
        abnormal and dislocated condition, they <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> have continually propounded distorted and
        degrading views of human nature, have represented it as altogether
        under the empire of evil, and have sometimes risen to such a height
        of extravagance as to pronounce the very virtues of the heathen to be
        of the nature of sin. But nothing can be more certain than that that
        which is exceptional and distinctive in human nature is not its vice,
        but its excellence. It is not the sensuality, cruelty, selfishness,
        passion, or envy, which are all displayed in equal or greater degrees
        in different departments of the animal world; it is that moral nature
        which enables man apparently, alone of all created beings, to
        classify his emotions, to oppose the current of his desires, and to
        aspire after moral perfection. Nor is it less certain that in
        civilised, and therefore developed man, the good greatly
        preponderates over the evil. Benevolence is more common than cruelty;
        the sight of suffering more readily produces pity than joy;
        gratitude, not ingratitude, is the normal result of a conferred
        benefit. The sympathies of man naturally follow heroism and goodness,
        and vice itself is usually but an exaggeration or distortion of
        tendencies that are in their own nature perfectly innocent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But these
        exaggerations of human depravity, which have attained their extreme
        limits in some Protestant sects, do not appear in the Church of the
        first three centuries. The sense of sin was not yet accompanied by a
        denial of the goodness that exists in man. Christianity was regarded
        rather as a redemption from error than from sin,<a id="noteref_2"
        name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> and it is
        a significant fact that the epithet <span class="tei tei-q">“well
        deserving,”</span> which the Pagans usually put upon their tombs, was
        also the favourite inscription in the Christian catacombs. The
        Pelagian controversy, the teaching of St. Augustine, and the progress
        of asceticism, gradually introduced the doctrine of the utter
        depravity of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg
        006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        man, which has proved in later times the fertile source of degrading
        superstition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In sustaining and
        defining the notion of sin, the early Church employed the machinery
        of an elaborate legislation. Constant communion with the Church was
        regarded as of the very highest importance. Participation in the
        Sacrament was believed to be essential to eternal life. At a very
        early period it was given to infants, and already in the time of St.
        Cyprian we find the practice universal in the Church, and pronounced
        by at least some of the Fathers to be ordinarily necessary to their
        salvation.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href=
        "#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> Among the
        adults it was customary to receive the Sacrament daily, in some
        churches four times a week.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href=
        "#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> Even in
        the days of persecution the only part of their service the Christians
        consented to omit was the half-secular agape.<a id="noteref_5" name=
        "noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> The
        clergy had power to accord or withhold access to the ceremonies, and
        the reverence with which they were regarded was so great that they
        were able to dictate their own conditions of communion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From these
        circumstances there very naturally arose a vast system of moral
        discipline. It was always acknowledged that men could only rightly
        approach the sacred table in certain moral dispositions, and it was
        very soon added that the commission of crimes should be expiated by a
        period of penance, before access to the communion was granted. A
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007"
        id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> multitude of offences, of very
        various degrees of magnitude, such as prolonged abstinence from
        religious services, prenuptial unchastity, prostitution, adultery,
        the adoption of the profession of gladiator or actor, idolatry, the
        betrayal of Christians to persecutors, and paiderastia or unnatural
        love, were specified, to each of which a definite spiritual penalty
        was annexed. The lowest penalty consisted of deprivation of the
        Eucharist for a few weeks. More serious offenders were deprived of it
        for a year, or for ten years, or until the hour of death, while in
        some cases the sentence amounted to the greater excommunication, or
        the deprivation of the Eucharist for ever. During the period of
        penance the penitent was compelled to abstain from the marriage-bed,
        and from all other pleasures, and to spend his time chiefly in
        religious exercises. Before he was readmitted to communion, he was
        accustomed publicly, before the assembled Christians, to appear clad
        in sackcloth, with ashes strewn upon his head, with his hair shaven
        off, and thus to throw himself at the feet of the minister, to
        confess aloud his sins, and to implore the favour of absolution. The
        excommunicated man was not only cut off for ever from the Christian
        rites; he was severed also from all intercourse with his former
        friends. No Christian, on pain of being himself excommunicated, might
        eat with him or speak with him. He must live hated and alone in this
        world, and be prepared for damnation in the next.<a id="noteref_6"
        name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This system of
        legislation, resting upon religious terrorism, forms one of the most
        important parts of early ecclesiastical history, and a leading object
        of the Councils was to develop or modify it. Although confession was
        not yet an habitual and universally obligatory rite, although it was
        only <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name=
        "Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> exacted in cases of
        notorious sins, it is manifest that we have in this system, not
        potentially or in germ, but in full developed activity, an
        ecclesiastical despotism of the most crushing order. But although
        this recognition of the right of the clergy to withhold from men what
        was believed to be essential to their salvation, laid the foundation
        of the worst superstitions of Rome, it had, on the other hand, a very
        valuable moral effect. Every system of law is a system of education,
        for it fixes in the minds of men certain conceptions of right and
        wrong, and of the proportionate enormity of different crimes; and no
        legislation was enforced with more solemnity, or appealed more
        directly to the religious feelings, than the penitential discipline
        of the Church. More than, perhaps, any other single agency, it
        confirmed that conviction of the enormity of sin, and of the
        retribution that follows it, which was one of the two great levers by
        which Christianity acted upon mankind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if
        Christianity was remarkable for its appeals to the selfish or
        interested side of our nature, it was far more remarkable for the
        empire it attained over disinterested enthusiasm. The Platonist
        exhorted men to imitate God; the Stoic, to follow reason; the
        Christian, to the love of Christ. The later Stoics had often united
        their notions of excellence in an ideal sage, and Epictetus had even
        urged his disciples to set before them some man of surpassing
        excellence, and to imagine him continually near them; but the utmost
        the Stoic ideal could become was a model for imitation, and the
        admiration it inspired could never deepen into affection. It was
        reserved for Christianity to present to the world an ideal character,
        which through all the changes of eighteen centuries has inspired the
        hearts of men with an impassioned love; has shown itself capable of
        acting on all ages, nations, temperaments, and conditions; has been
        not only the highest pattern of virtue but the strongest incentive to
        its practice; and has exercised so deep an influence that it may be
        truly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name=
        "Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> said that the simple
        record of three short years of active life has done more to
        regenerate and to soften mankind than all the disquisitions of
        philosophers, and all the exhortations of moralists. This has indeed
        been the well-spring of whatever is best and purest in the Christian
        life. Amid all the sins and failings, amid all the priestcraft and
        persecution and fanaticism that have defaced the Church, it has
        preserved, in the character and example of its Founder, an enduring
        principle of regeneration. Perfect love knows no rights. It creates a
        boundless, uncalculating self-abnegation that transforms the
        character, and is the parent of every virtue. Side by side with the
        terrorism and the superstitions of dogmatism, there have ever existed
        in Christianity those who would echo the wish of St. Theresa, that
        she could blot out both heaven and hell, to serve God for Himself
        alone; and the power of the love of Christ has been displayed alike
        in the most heroic pages of Christian martyrdom, in the most pathetic
        pages of Christian resignation, in the tenderest pages of Christian
        charity. It was shown by the martyrs who sank beneath the fangs of
        wild beasts, extending to the last moment their arms in the form of
        the cross they loved;<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href=

        who know how imperfectly the simple sense of duty can with most men
        resist the energy of the passions; who have observed how barren
        Mohammedanism has been in all the higher and more tender virtues,
        because its noble morality and its pure theism have been united with
        no living example; who, above all, have traced through the history of
        the Christian Church the influence of the love of Christ, will be at
        no loss to estimate the value of this purest and most distinctive
        source of Christian enthusiasm. In one respect we can scarcely
        realise its effects upon the early Church. The sense of the fixity of
        natural laws is now so deeply implanted in the minds of men, that no
        truly educated person, whatever may be his religious opinions,
        seriously believes that all the more startling phenomena around
        him—storms, earthquakes, invasions, or famines—are results of
        isolated acts of supernatural power, and are intended to affect some
        human interest. But by the early Christians all these things were
        directly traced to the Master they so dearly loved. The result of
        this conviction was a state of feeling we can now barely understand.
        A great poet, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg
        011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in
        lines which are among the noblest in English literature, has spoken
        of one who had died as united to the all-pervading soul of nature,
        the grandeur and the tenderness, the beauty and the passion of his
        being blending with the kindred elements of the universe, his voice
        heard in all its melodies, his spirit a presence to be felt and
        known, a part of the one plastic energy that permeates and animates
        the globe. Something of this kind, but of a far more vivid and real
        character, was the belief of the early Christian world. The universe,
        to them, was transfigured by love. All its phenomena, all its
        catastrophes, were read in a new light, were endued with a new
        significance, acquired a religious sanctity. Christianity offered a
        deeper consolation than any prospect of endless life, or of
        millennial glories. It taught the weary, the sorrowing, and the
        lonely, to look up to heaven and to say, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thou, God, carest for me.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
        surprising that a religious system which made it a main object to
        inculcate moral excellence, and which by its doctrine of future
        retribution, by its organisation, and by its capacity of producing a
        disinterested enthusiasm, acquired an unexampled supremacy over the
        human mind, should have raised its disciples to a very high condition
        of sanctity. There can, indeed, be little doubt that, for nearly two
        hundred years after its establishment in Europe, the Christian
        community exhibited a moral purity which, if it has been equalled,
        has never for any long period been surpassed. Completely separated
        from the Roman world that was around them, abstaining alike from
        political life, from appeals to the tribunals, and from military
        occupations; looking forward continually to the immediate advent of
        their Master, and the destruction of the Empire in which they dwelt,
        and animated by all the fervour of a young religion, the Christians
        found within themselves a whole order of ideas and feelings
        sufficiently powerful to guard them from the contamination of their
        age. In their general bearing towards society, and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the nature and minuteness of their
        scruples, they probably bore a greater resemblance to the Quakers
        than to any other existing sect.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13"
        href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> Some
        serious signs of moral decadence might, indeed, be detected even
        before the Decian persecution; and it was obvious that the triumph of
        the Church, by introducing numerous nominal Christians into its pale,
        by exposing it to the temptations of wealth and prosperity, and by
        forcing it into connection with secular politics, must have damped
        its zeal and impaired its purity; yet few persons, I think, who had
        contemplated Christianity as it existed in the first three centuries
        would have imagined it possible that it should completely supersede
        the Pagan worship around it; that its teachers should bend the
        mightiest monarchs to their will, and stamp their influence on every
        page of legislation, and direct the whole course of civilisation for
        a thousand years; and yet that the period in which they were so
        supreme should have been one of the most contemptible in history.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The leading
        features of that period may be shortly told. From the death of Marcus
        Aurelius, about which time Christianity assumed an important
        influence in the Roman world, the decadence of the Empire was rapid
        and almost uninterrupted. The first Christian emperor transferred his
        capital to a new city, uncontaminated by the traditions and the
        glories of Paganism; and he there founded an Empire which derived all
        its ethics from Christian sources, and which continued in
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013"
        id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> existence for about eleven
        hundred years. Of that Byzantine Empire the universal verdict of
        history is that it constitutes, with scarcely an exception, the most
        thoroughly base and despicable form that civilisation has yet
        assumed. Though very cruel and very sensual, there have been times
        when cruelty assumed more ruthless, and sensuality more extravagant,
        aspects; but there has been no other enduring civilisation so
        absolutely destitute of all the forms and elements of greatness, and
        none to which the epithet mean may be so emphatically applied. The
        Byzantine Empire was pre-eminently the age of treachery. Its vices
        were the vices of men who had ceased to be brave without learning to
        be virtuous. Without patriotism, without the fruition or desire of
        liberty, after the first paroxysms of religious agitation, without
        genius or intellectual activity; slaves, and willing slaves, in both
        their actions and their thoughts, immersed in sensuality and in the
        most frivolous pleasures, the people only emerged from their
        listlessness when some theological subtilty, or some rivalry in the
        chariot races, stimulated them into frantic riots. They exhibited all
        the externals of advanced civilisation. They possessed knowledge;
        they had continually before them the noble literature of ancient
        Greece, instinct with the loftiest heroism; but that literature,
        which afterwards did so much to revivify Europe, could fire the
        degenerate Greeks with no spark or semblance of nobility. The history
        of the Empire is a monotonous story of the intrigues of priests,
        eunuchs, and women, of poisonings, of conspiracies, of uniform
        ingratitude, of perpetual fratricides. After the conversion of
        Constantine there was no prince in any section of the Roman Empire
        altogether so depraved, or at least so shameless, as Nero or
        Heliogabalus; but the Byzantine Empire can show none bearing the
        faintest resemblance to Antonine or Marcus Aurelius, while the
        nearest approximation to that character at Rome was furnished by the
        Emperor Julian, who contemptuously abandoned the Christian faith. At
        last the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg
        014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Mohammedan invasion terminated the long decrepitude of the Eastern
        Empire. Constantinople sank beneath the Crescent, its inhabitants
        wrangling about theological differences to the very moment of their
        fall.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Asiatic
        Churches had already perished. The Christian faith, planted in the
        dissolute cities of Asia Minor, had produced many fanatical ascetics
        and a few illustrious theologians, but it had no renovating effect
        upon the people at large. It introduced among them a principle of
        interminable and implacable dissension, but it scarcely tempered in
        any appreciable degree their luxury or their sensuality. The frenzy
        of pleasure continued unabated, and in a great part of the Empire it
        seemed, indeed, only to have attained its climax after the triumph of
        Christianity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The condition of
        the Western Empire was somewhat different. Not quite a century after
        the conversion of Constantine, the Imperial city was captured by
        Alaric, and a long series of barbarian invasions at last dissolved
        the whole framework of Roman society, while the barbarians
        themselves, having adopted the Christian faith and submitted
        absolutely to the Christian priests, the Church, which remained the
        guardian of all the treasures of antiquity, was left with a virgin
        soil to realise her ideal of human excellence. Nor did she fall short
        of what might have been expected. She exercised for many centuries an
        almost absolute empire over the thoughts and actions of mankind, and
        created a civilisation which was permeated in every part with
        ecclesiastical influence. And the dark ages, as the period of
        Catholic ascendancy is justly called, do undoubtedly display many
        features of great and genuine excellence. In active benevolence, in
        the spirit of reverence, in loyalty, in co-operative habits, they far
        transcend the noblest ages of Pagan antiquity, while in that humanity
        which shrinks from the infliction of suffering, they were superior to
        Roman, and in their respect for chastity, to Greek civilisation. On
        the other hand, they rank <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg
        015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        immeasurably below the best Pagan civilisations in civic and
        patriotic virtues, in the love of liberty, in the number and
        splendour of the great characters they produced, in the dignity and
        beauty of the type of character they formed. They had their full
        share of tumult, anarchy, injustice, and war, and they should
        probably be placed, in all intellectual virtues, lower than any other
        period in the history of mankind. A boundless intolerance of all
        divergence of opinion was united with an equally boundless toleration
        of all falsehood and deliberate fraud that could favour received
        opinions. Credulity being taught as a virtue, and all conclusions
        dictated by authority, a deadly torpor sank upon the human mind,
        which for many centuries almost suspended its action, and was only
        effectually broken by the scrutinising, innovating, and free-thinking
        habits that accompanied the rise of the industrial republics in
        Italy. Few men who are not either priests or monks would not have
        preferred to live in the best days of the Athenian or of the Roman
        republics, in the age of Augustus or in the age of the Antonines,
        rather than in any period that elapsed between the triumph of
        Christianity and the fourteenth century.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is, indeed,
        difficult to conceive any clearer proof than was furnished by the
        history of the twelve hundred years after the conversion of
        Constantine, that while theology has undoubtedly introduced into the
        world certain elements and principles of good, scarcely if at all
        known to antiquity, while its value as a tincture or modifying
        influence in society can hardly be overrated, it is by no means for
        the advantage of mankind that, in the form which the Greek and
        Catholic Churches present, it should become a controlling arbiter of
        civilisation. It is often said that the Roman world before
        Constantine was in a period of rapid decay; that the traditions and
        vitality of half-suppressed Paganism account for many of the
        aberrations of later times; that the influence of the Church was
        often rather nominal and superficial than <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> supreme; and that, in judging the ignorance of
        the dark ages, we must make large allowance for the dislocations of
        society by the barbarians. In all this there is much truth; but when
        we remember that in the Byzantine Empire the renovating power of
        theology was tried in a new capital free from Pagan traditions, and
        for more than one thousand years unsubdued by barbarians, and that in
        the West the Church, for at least seven hundred years after the
        shocks of the invasions had subsided, exercised a control more
        absolute than any other moral or intellectual agency has ever
        attained, it will appear, I think, that the experiment was very
        sufficiently tried. It is easy to make a catalogue of the glaring
        vices of antiquity, and to contrast them with the pure morality of
        Christian writings; but, if we desire to form a just estimate of the
        realised improvement, we must compare the classical and
        ecclesiastical civilisations as wholes, and must observe in each case
        not only the vices that were repressed, but also the degree and
        variety of positive excellence attained. In the first two centuries
        of the Christian Church the moral elevation was extremely high, and
        was continually appealed to as a proof of the divinity of the creed.
        In the century before the conversion of Constantine, a marked
        depression was already manifest. The two centuries after Constantine
        are uniformly represented by the Fathers as a period of general and
        scandalous vice. The ecclesiastical civilisation that followed,
        though not without its distinctive merits, assuredly supplies no
        justification of the common boast about the regeneration of society
        by the Church. That the civilisation of the last three centuries has
        risen in most respects to a higher level than any that had preceded
        it, I at least firmly believe; but theological ethics, though very
        important, form but one of the many and complex elements of its
        excellence. Mechanical inventions, the habits of industrial life, the
        discoveries of physical science, the improvements of government, the
        expansion of literature, the traditions of Pagan antiquity,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017"
        id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> have all a distinguished
        place, while, the more fully its history is investigated, the more
        clearly two capital truths are disclosed. The first is that the
        influence of theology having for centuries numbed and paralysed the
        whole intellect of Christian Europe, the revival, which forms the
        starting-point of our modern civilisation, was mainly due to the fact
        that two spheres of intellect still remained uncontrolled by the
        sceptre of Catholicism. The Pagan literature of antiquity, and the
        Mohammedan schools of science, were the chief agencies in
        resuscitating the dormant energies of Christendom. The second fact,
        which I have elsewhere endeavoured to establish in detail, is that
        during more than three centuries the decadence of theological
        influence has been one of the most invariable signs and measures of
        our progress. In medicine, physical science, commercial interests,
        politics, and even ethics, the reformer has been confronted with
        theological affirmations which barred his way, which were all
        defended as of vital importance, and were all in turn compelled to
        yield before the secularising influence of civilisation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have here,
        then, a problem of deep interest and importance, which I propose to
        investigate in the present chapter. We have to enquire why it was
        that a religion which was not more remarkable for the beauty of its
        moral teaching than for the power with which it acted upon mankind,
        and which during the last few centuries has been the source of
        countless blessings to the world, should have proved itself for so
        long a period, and under such a variety of conditions, altogether
        unable to regenerate Europe. The question is not one of languid or
        imperfect action, but of conflicting agencies. In the vast and
        complex organism of Catholicity there were some parts which acted
        with admirable force in improving and elevating mankind. There were
        others which had a directly opposite effect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first aspect
        in which Christianity presented itself to the world was as a
        declaration of the fraternity of men in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Christ. Considered as immortal beings, destined
        for the extremes of happiness or of misery, and united to one another
        by a special community of redemption, the first and most manifest
        duty of a Christian man was to look upon his fellow-men as sacred
        beings, and from this notion grew up the eminently Christian idea of
        the sanctity of all human life. I have already endeavoured to
        show—and the fact is of such capital importance in meeting the common
        objections to the reality of natural moral perceptions, that I
        venture, at the risk of tediousness, to recur to it—that nature does
        not tell man that it is wrong to slay without provocation his
        fellow-men. Not to dwell upon those early stages of barbarism in
        which the higher faculties of human nature are still undeveloped, and
        almost in the condition of embryo, it is an historical fact beyond
        all dispute, that refined, and even moral societies have existed, in
        which the slaughter of men of some particular class or nation has
        been regarded with no more compunction than the slaughter of animals
        in the chase. The early Greeks, in their dealings with the
        barbarians; the Romans, in their dealings with gladiators, and in
        some periods of their history, with slaves; the Spaniards, in their
        dealings with Indians; nearly all colonists removed from European
        supervision, in their dealings with an inferior race; an immense
        proportion of the nations of antiquity, in their dealings with
        new-born infants, display this complete and absolute callousness, and
        we may discover traces of it even in our own islands and within the
        last three hundred years.<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href=
        "#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> And
        difficult as it may be to realise it in our day, when the atrocity of
        all wanton slaughter of men has become an essential part of our moral
        feelings, it is nevertheless an incontestable fact <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that this callousness has been
        continually shown by good men, by men who in all other respects would
        be regarded in any age as conspicuous for their humanity. In the days
        of the Tudors, the best Englishmen delighted in what we should now
        deem the most barbarous sports, and it is absolutely certain that in
        antiquity men of genuine humanity—tender relations, loving friends,
        charitable neighbours—men in whose eyes the murder of a
        fellow-citizen would have appeared as atrocious as in our own,
        attended, instituted, and applauded gladiatorial games, or counselled
        without a scruple the exposition of infants. But it is, as I
        conceive, a complete confusion of thought to imagine, as is so
        commonly done, that any accumulation of facts of this nature throws
        the smallest doubt upon the reality of innate moral perceptions. All
        that the intuitive moralist asserts is that we know by nature that
        there is a distinction between humanity and cruelty; that the first
        belongs to the higher or better part of our nature, and that it is
        our duty to cultivate it. The standard of the age, which is itself
        determined by the general condition of society, constitutes the
        natural line of duty; for he who falls below it contributes to
        depress it. Now, there is no fact more absolutely certain than that
        nations and ages which have differed most widely as to the standard
        have been perfectly unanimous as to the excellence of humanity.
        Plato, who recommended infanticide; Cato, who sold his aged slaves;
        Pliny, who applauded the games of the arena; the old generals, who
        made their prisoners slaves or gladiators, as well as the modern
        generals, who refuse to impose upon them any degrading labour; the
        old legislators, who filled their codes with sentences of torture,
        mutilation, and hideous forms of death, as well as the modern
        legislators, who are continually seeking to abridge the punishment of
        the most guilty; the old disciplinarian, who governed by force, as
        well as the modern instructor, who governs by sympathy; the Spanish

        streams from the explosive dart that quivers in its neck; as well as
        the reformers we sometimes meet, who are scandalised by all field
        sports, or by the sacrifice of animal life for food; or who will eat
        only the larger animals, in order to reduce the sacrifice of life to
        a minimum; or who are continually inventing new methods of quickening
        animal death—all these persons, widely as they differ in their acts
        and in their judgments of what things should be called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“brutal,”</span> and of what things should be called
        <span class="tei tei-q">“fantastic,”</span> agree in believing
        humanity to be better than cruelty, and in attaching a definite
        condemnation to acts that fall below the standard of their country
        and their time. Now, it was one of the most important services of
        Christianity, that besides quickening greatly our benevolent
        affections it definitely and dogmatically asserted the sinfulness of
        all destruction of human life as a matter of amusement, or of simple
        convenience, and thereby formed a new standard higher than any which
        then existed in the world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The influence of
        Christianity in this respect began with the very earliest stage of
        human life. The practice of abortion was one to which few persons in
        antiquity attached any deep feeling of condemnation. I have noticed
        in a former chapter that the physiological theory that the fœtus did
        not become a living creature till the hour of birth, had some
        influence on the judgments passed upon this practice; and even where
        this theory was not generally held, it is easy to account for the
        prevalence of the act. The death of an unborn child does not appeal
        very powerfully to the feeling of compassion, and men who had not yet
        attained any strong sense of the sanctity of human life, who believed
        that they might regulate their conduct on these matters by
        utilitarian views, according to the general interest of the
        community, might very readily conclude that the prevention of birth
        was in many cases an act of mercy. In Greece, Aristotle not
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021"
        id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> only countenanced the
        practice, but even desired that it should be enforced by law, when
        population had exceeded certain assigned limits.<a id="noteref_15"
        name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> No law
        in Greece, or in the Roman Republic, or during the greater part of
        the Empire, condemned it;<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href=
        "#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> and if,
        as has been thought, some measure was adopted condemnatory of it
        before the close of the Pagan Empire, that measure was altogether
        inoperative. A long chain of writers, both Pagan and Christian,
        represent the practice as avowed and almost universal. They describe
        it as resulting, not simply from licentiousness or from poverty, but
        even from so slight a motive as vanity, which made mothers shrink
        from the disfigurement of childbirth. They speak of a mother who had
        never destroyed her unborn offspring as deserving of signal praise,
        and they assure us that the frequency of the crime was such that it
        gave rise to a regular profession. At the same time, while Ovid,
        Seneca, Favorinus the Stoic of Arles, Plutarch, and Juvenal, all
        speak of abortion as general and notorious, they all speak of it as
        unquestionably criminal.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href=
        "#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> It was
        probably regarded by the average Romans of the later days of Paganism
        much as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name=
        "Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Englishmen in the last
        century regarded convivial excesses, as certainly wrong, but so
        venial as scarcely to deserve censure.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The language of
        the Christians from the very beginning was widely different. With
        unwavering consistency and with the strongest emphasis, they
        denounced the practice, not simply as inhuman, but as definitely
        murder. In the penitential discipline of the Church, abortion was
        placed in the same category as infanticide, and the stern sentence to
        which the guilty person was subject imprinted on the minds of
        Christians, more deeply than any mere exhortations, a sense of the
        enormity of the crime. By the Council of Ancyra the guilty mother was
        excluded from the Sacrament till the very hour of death; and though
        this penalty was soon reduced, first to ten and afterwards to seven
        years' penitence,<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href=
        "#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> the
        offence still ranked amongst the gravest in the legislation of the
        Church. In one very remarkable way the reforms of Christianity in
        this sphere were powerfully sustained by a doctrine which is perhaps
        the most revolting in the whole theology of the Fathers. To the
        Pagans, even when condemning abortion and infanticide, these crimes
        appeared comparatively trivial, because the victims seemed very
        insignificant and their sufferings very slight. The death of an adult
        man who is struck down in the midst of his enterprise and his hopes,
        who is united by ties of love or friendship to multitudes around him,
        and whose departure causes a perturbation and a pang to the society
        in which he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg
        023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> has
        moved, excites feelings very different from any produced by the
        painless extinction of a new-born infant, which, having scarcely
        touched the earth, has known none of its cares and very little of its
        love. But to the theologian this infant life possessed a fearful
        significance. The moment, they taught, the fœtus in the womb acquired
        animation, it became an immortal being, destined, even if it died
        unborn, to be raised again on the last day, responsible for the sin
        of Adam, and doomed, if it perished without baptism, to be excluded
        for ever from heaven and to be cast, as the Greeks taught, into a
        painless and joyless limbo, or, as the Latins taught, into the abyss
        of hell. It is probably, in a considerable degree, to this doctrine
        that we owe in the first instance the healthy sense of the value and
        sanctity of infant life which so broadly distinguishes Christian from
        Pagan societies, and which is now so thoroughly incorporated with our
        moral feelings as to be independent of all doctrinal changes. That
        which appealed so powerfully to the compassion of the early and
        mediæval Christians, in the fate of the murdered infants, was not
        that they died, but that they commonly died unbaptised; and the
        criminality of abortion was immeasurably aggravated when it was
        believed to involve, not only the extinction of a transient life, but
        also the damnation of an immortal soul.<a id="noteref_19" name=

        before birth, slew a pregnant woman, committing thereby a double
        murder, that of the mother and of the child in her womb. Stung by
        remorse, the murderer fled to the desert, and passed the remainder of
        his life in constant penance and prayer. At last, after many years,
        the voice of God told him that he had been forgiven the murder of the
        woman. But yet his end was a clouded one. He never could obtain an
        assurance that he had been forgiven the death of the child.<a id=

        history of this crime is somewhat peculiar.<a id="noteref_21" name=

        habits are eminently unfavourable to infant life, it is, as might be
        expected, the usual custom for the parent to decide whether he
        desires to preserve the child he has called into existence, and if he
        does not, to expose or slay it. In nations that have passed out of
        the stage of barbarism, but are still rude and simple in their
        habits, the practice of infanticide is usually rare; but, unlike
        other crimes of violence, it is not naturally diminished by the
        progress of civilisation, for, after the period of savage life is
        passed, its prevalence is influenced much more by the sensuality than

        legislations of Lycurgus and Solon. Regarding the community as a
        whole, they clearly saw that it is in the highest degree for the
        interest of society that the increase of population should be very
        jealously restricted, and that the State should be as far as possible
        free from helpless and unproductive members; and they therefore
        concluded that the painless destruction of infant life, and
        especially of those infants who were so deformed or diseased that
        their lives, if prolonged, would probably have been a burden to
        themselves, was on the whole a benefit. The very sensual tone of
        Greek life rendered the modern notion of prolonged continence wholly
        alien to their thoughts; and the extremely low social and
        intellectual condition of Greek mothers, who exercised no appreciable
        influence over the habits of thought of the nation should also, I
        think, be taken into account, for it has always been observed that
        mothers are much more distinguished than fathers for their affection
        for infants that have not yet manifested the first dawning of reason.
        Even in Greece, however, infanticide and exposition were not
        universally permitted. In Thebes these offences are said to have been
        punished by death.<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The power of life
        and death, which in Rome was originally conceded to the father over
        his children, would appear to involve an unlimited permission of
        infanticide; but a very old law, popularly ascribed to Romulus, in
        this respect restricted the parental rights, enjoining the father to
        bring up <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg
        027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> all
        his male children, and at least his eldest female child, forbidding
        him to destroy any well-formed child till it had completed its third
        year, when the affections of the parent might be supposed to be
        developed, but permitting the exposition of deformed or maimed
        children with the consent of their five nearest relations.<a id=
        "noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class=

        Roman policy was always to encourage, while the Greek policy was
        rather to restrain, population, and infanticide never appears to have
        been common in Rome till the corrupt and sensual days of the Empire.
        The legislators then absolutely condemned it, and it was indirectly
        discouraged by laws which accorded special privileges to the fathers
        of many children, exempted poor parents from most of the burden of
        taxation, and in some degree provided for the security of exposed
        infants. Public opinion probably differed little from that of our own
        day as to the fact, though it differed from it much as to the degree,
        of its criminality. It was, as will be remembered, one of the charges
        most frequently brought against the Christians, and it was one that
        never failed to arouse popular indignation. Pagan and Christian
        authorities are, however, united in speaking of infanticide as a
        crying vice of the Empire, and Tertullian observed that no laws were
        more easily or more constantly evaded than those which condemned
        it.<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> A broad
        distinction was popularly drawn between infanticide and exposition.
        The latter, though probably condemned, was certainly not punished by
        law;<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class=

        gigantic scale and with absolute impunity, noticed by writers with
        the most frigid indifference, and, at least in the case of destitute
        parents, considered a very venial offence.<a id="noteref_28" name=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> Often,
        no doubt, the exposed children perished, but more frequently the very
        extent of the practice saved the lives of the victims. They were
        brought systematically to a column near the Velabrum, and there taken
        by speculators, who educated them as slaves, or very frequently as
        prostitutes.<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the whole, what
        was demanded on this subject was not any clearer moral teaching, but
        rather a stronger enforcement of the condemnation long since passed
        upon infanticide, and an increased protection for exposed infants. By
        the penitential sentences, by the dogmatic considerations I have
        enumerated, and by the earnest exhortations both of her preachers and
        writers, the Church laboured to deepen the sense of the enormity of
        the act, and especially to convince men that the guilt of abandoning
        their children to the precarious and doubtful mercy of the stranger
        was scarcely less than that of simple infanticide.<a id="noteref_30"
        name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> In the
        civil law her influence was also displayed, though not, I think, very
        advantageously. By the counsel, it is said, of Lactantius,
        Constantine, in the very year of his conversion, in order to diminish
        infanticide by destitute parents, issued a decree, applicable in the
        first instance to Italy, but extended in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 322 to Africa, in which
        he commanded that those children whom their parents were unable to
        support should be clothed and fed at the expense of the State,<a id=
        "noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        which had already been pursued on a large scale under the Antonines.
        In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 331, a law intended to
        multiply the chances of the exposed child being taken charge of by
        some charitable or interested person, provided that the foundling
        should remain the absolute property of its saviour, whether he
        adopted it as a son <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg
        030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or
        employed it as a slave, and that the parent should not have power at
        any future time to reclaim it.<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32"
        href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> By
        another law, which had been issued in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 329, it had been
        provided that children who had been, not exposed, but sold, might be
        reclaimed upon payment by the father.<a id="noteref_33" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last two laws
        cannot be regarded with unmingled satisfaction. The law regulating
        the condition of exposed children, though undoubtedly enacted with
        the most benevolent intentions, was in some degree a retrograde step,
        the Pagan laws having provided that the father might always withdraw
        the child he had exposed, from servitude, by payment of the expenses
        incurred in supporting it,<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href=
        "#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> while
        Trajan had even decided that the exposed child could not become under
        any circumstance a slave.<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href=
        "#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> The law
        of Constantine, on the other hand, doomed it to an irrevocable
        servitude; and this law continued in force till <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 529, when Justinian,
        reverting to the principle of Trajan, decreed that not only the
        father lost all legitimate authority over his child by exposing it,
        but also that the person who had saved it could not by that act
        deprive it of its natural liberty. But this law applied only to the
        Eastern Empire; and in part at least of the West<a id="noteref_36"
        name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> the
        servitude of exposed infants continued for centuries, and appears
        only to have terminated with the general extinction of slavery in
        Europe. The law of Constantine concerning the sale of children was
        also a step, though perhaps a necessary step, of retrogression. A
        series of emperors, among whom Caracalla was conspicuous, had
        denounced and endeavoured to abolish, as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“shameful,”</span> the traffic in free children, and
        Diocletian had expressly and absolutely condemned it.<a id=
        "noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The extreme misery, however,
        resulting from the civil wars under Constantine, had rendered it
        necessary to authorise the old practice of selling children in the
        case of absolute destitution, which, though it had been condemned,
        had probably never altogether ceased. Theodosius the Great attempted
        to take a step in advance, by decreeing that the children thus sold
        might regain their freedom without the repayment of the
        purchase-money, a temporary service being a sufficient compensation
        for the purchase;<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href=
        "#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> but this
        measure was repealed by Valentinian III. The sale of children in case
        of great necessity, though denounced by the Fathers,<a id=
        "noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a>
        continued long after the time of Theodosius, nor does any Christian
        emperor appear to have enforced the humane enactment of
        Diocletian.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Together with
        these measures for the protection of exposed children, there were
        laws directly condemnatory of infanticide. This branch of the subject
        is obscured by much ambiguity and controversy; but it appears most
        probable that the Pagan legislation reckoned infanticide as a form of
        homicide, though, being deemed less atrocious than other forms of
        homicide, it was punished, not by death, but by banishment.<a id=

        Constantine, intended principally, and perhaps exclusively, for
        Africa, where the sacrifices of children to Saturn were very common,
        assimilated to parricide the murder of a child by its father;<a id=

        finally, Valentinian, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        infanticide a capital offence,<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not possible
        to ascertain, with any degree of accuracy, what diminution of
        infanticide resulted from these measures. It may, however, be safely
        asserted that the publicity of the trade in exposed children became
        impossible under the influence of Christianity, and that the sense of
        the serious nature of the crime was very considerably increased. The
        extreme destitution, which was one of its most fertile causes, was
        met by Christian charity. Many exposed children appear to have been
        educated by individual Christians.<a id="noteref_46" name=

        Brephotrophia and Orphanotrophia are among the earliest recorded
        charitable institutions of the Church; but it is not certain that
        exposed children were admitted into them, and we find no trace for
        several centuries of Christian foundling hospitals. This form of
        charity grew up gradually in the early part of the middle ages. It is
        said that one existed at Trêves in the sixth, and at Angers in the
        seventh century, and it is certain that one existed at Milan in the
        eighth century.<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href=
        "#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        Council of Rouen, in the ninth century, invited women who had
        secretly borne children to place them at the door of the church, and
        undertook to provide for them if they were not reclaimed. It is
        probable that they were brought up among <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the numerous slaves or serfs attached to the
        ecclesiastical properties; for a decree of the Council of Arles, in
        the fifth century, and afterwards a law of Charlemagne, had echoed
        the enactment of Constantine, declaring that exposed children should
        be the slaves of their protectors. As slavery declined, the memorials
        of many sins, like many other of the discordant elements of mediæval
        society, were doubtless absorbed and consecrated in the monastic
        societies. The strong sense always evinced in the Church of the
        enormity of unchastity probably rendered the ecclesiastics more
        cautious in this than in other forms of charity, for institutions
        especially intended for deserted children advanced but slowly. Even
        Rome, the mother of many charities, could boast of none till the
        beginning of the thirteenth century.<a id="noteref_48" name=

        the middle of the twelfth century we find societies at Milan charged,
        among other functions, with seeking for exposed children. Towards the
        close of the same century, a monk of Montpellier, whose very name is
        doubtful, but who is commonly spoken of as Brother Guy, founded a
        confraternity called by the name of the Holy Ghost, and devoted to
        the protection and education of children; and this society in the two
        following centuries ramified over a great part of Europe.<a id=

        id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> century the Hospital of the
        Holy Ghost at Paris even refused to admit deserted children, yet the
        care of foundlings soon passed in a great measure into its hands. At
        last, after many complaints of the frequency of infanticide, St.
        Vincent de Paul arose, and gave so great an impulse to that branch of
        charity that he may be regarded as its second author, and his
        influence was felt not only in private charities, but in legislative
        enactments. Into the effects of these measures—the encouragement of
        the vice of incontinence by institutions that were designed to
        suppress the crime of infanticide, and the serious moral
        controversies suggested by this apparent conflict between the
        interests of humanity and of chastity—it is not necessary for me to
        enter. We are at present concerned with the principles that actuated
        Christian charity, not with the wisdom of its organisations. Whatever
        mistakes may have been made, the entire movement I have traced
        displays an anxiety not only for the life, but also for the moral
        well-being, of the castaways of society, such as the most humane
        nations of antiquity had never reached. This minute and scrupulous
        care for human life and human virtue in the humblest forms, in the
        slave, the gladiator, the savage, or the infant, was indeed wholly
        foreign to the genius of Paganism. It was produced by the Christian
        doctrine of the inestimable value of each immortal soul. It is the
        distinguishing and transcendent characteristic of every society into
        which the spirit of Christianity has passed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The influence of
        Christianity in the protection of infant life, though very real, may
        be, and I think often has been, exaggerated. It would be difficult to
        overrate its influence in the sphere we have next to examine. There
        is scarcely any other single reform so important in the moral history
        of mankind as the suppression of the gladiatorial shows, and this
        feat must be almost exclusively ascribed to the Christian Church.
        When we remember how extremely few of the best and greatest men of
        the Roman world had absolutely <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class=

        impossible to regard, without the deepest admiration, the unwavering
        and uncompromising consistency of the patristic denunciations. And
        even comparing the Fathers with the most enlightened Pagan moralists
        in their treatment of this matter, we shall usually find one most
        significant difference. The Pagan, in the spirit of philosophy,
        denounced these games as inhuman, or demoralising, or degrading, or
        brutal. The Christian, in the spirit of the Church, represented them
        as a definite sin, the sin of murder, for which the spectators as
        well as the actors were directly responsible before Heaven. In the
        very latest days of the Pagan Empire, magnificent amphitheatres were
        still arising,<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href=

        condemned to fight. Honorius prohibited any slave who had been a
        gladiator passing into the service of a senator; but the real object
        of this last measure was, I imagine, not so much to stigmatise the
        gladiator, as to guard against the danger of an armed nobility.<a id=

        more important fact is that the spectacles were never introduced into
        the new capital of Constantine. At Rome, though they became less
        numerous, they do not appear to have been suspended until their final
        suppression. The passion for gladiators was the worst, while
        religious liberty was probably the best, feature of the old Pagan
        society; and it is a melancholy fact that of these two it was the
        nobler part that in the Christian Empire was first destroyed.
        Theodosius the Great, who suppressed all diversity of worship
        throughout the Empire, and who showed himself on many occasions the
        docile slave of the clergy, won the applause of the Pagan Symmachus
        by compelling his barbarian prisoners to fight as gladiators.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But although the
        suppression of the gladiatorial shows was not effected in the
        metropolis of the Empire till nearly ninety years after Christianity
        had been the State religion, the distinction between the teaching of
        the Christians and Pagans on the subject remained unimpaired. To the
        last, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name=
        "Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the most estimable of
        the Pagans appear to have regarded them with favour or indifference.
        Julian, it is true, with a rare magnanimity, refused persistently, in
        his conflict with Christianity, to avail himself, as he might most
        easily have done, of the popular passion for games which the Church
        condemned; but Libanius has noticed them with some approbation,<a id=
        "noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a> and
        Symmachus, as we have already seen, both instituted and applauded
        them. But the Christians steadily refused to admit any professional
        gladiator to baptism till he had pledged himself to abandon his
        calling, and every Christian who attended the games was excluded from
        communion. The preachers and writers of the Church denounced them
        with the most unqualified vehemence, and the poet Prudentius made a
        direct and earnest appeal to the emperor to suppress them. In the
        East, where they had never taken very firm root, they appear to have
        ceased about the time of Theodosius, and a passion for chariot races,
        which rose to the most extravagant height at Constantinople and in
        many other cities, took their place. In the West, the last
        gladiatorial show was celebrated at Rome, under Honorius, in
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 404, in honour of the
        triumph of Stilicho, when an Asiatic monk, named Telemachus, animated
        by the noblest heroism of philanthropy, rushed into the amphitheatre,
        and attempted to part the combatants. He perished beneath a shower of
        stones flung by the angry spectators; but his death led to the final
        abolition of the games.<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href=
        "#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> Combats
        of men with wild beasts continued, however, much later, and were
        especially popular in the East. The difficulty of procuring wild
        animals, amid the general poverty, contributed, with other causes, to
        their decline. They sank, at last, into games of cruelty to animals,
        but of little danger to men, and were finally condemned, at the end
        of the seventh century, by the Council of Trullo.<a id="noteref_63"

        fights, which continued through the whole of the middle ages, and
        which Petrarch declares were in his days sometimes attended with
        considerable bloodshed, may perhaps be traced in some degree to the
        traditions of the amphitheatre.<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The extinction of
        the gladiatorial spectacles is, of all the results of early Christian
        influence, that upon which the historian can look with the deepest
        and most unmingled satisfaction. Horrible as was the bloodshed they
        directly caused, these games were perhaps still more pernicious on
        account of the callousness of feeling they diffused through all
        classes, the fatal obstacle they presented to any general elevation
        of the standard of humanity. Yet the attitude of the Pagans
        decisively proves that no progress of philosophy or social
        civilisation was likely, for a very long period, to have extirpated
        them; and it can hardly be doubted that, had they been flourishing
        unchallenged as in the days of Trajan, when the rude warriors of the
        North obtained the empire of Italy, they would have been eagerly
        adopted by the conquerors, would have taken deep root in mediæval
        life, and have indefinitely retarded the progress of humanity.
        Christianity alone was powerful enough to tear this evil plant from
        the Roman soil. The Christian custom of legacies for the relief of
        the indigent and suffering replaced the Pagan custom of bequeathing
        sums of money for games in honour of the dead; and the month of
        December, which was looked forward to with eagerness through all the
        Roman world, as the special season of the gladiatorial spectacles,
        was consecrated in the Church by another festival commemorative of
        the advent of Christ.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The notion of the
        sanctity of human life, which led the early Christians to combat and
        at last to overthrow the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg
        039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        gladiatorial games, was carried by some of them to an extent
        altogether irreconcilable with national independence, and with the
        prevailing penal system. Many of them taught that no Christian might
        lawfully take away life, either as a soldier, or by bringing a
        capital charge, or by acting as an executioner. The first of these
        questions it will be convenient to reserve for a later period of this
        chapter, when I propose to examine the relations of Christianity to
        the military spirit, and a very few words will be sufficient to
        dispose of the others. The notion that there is something impure and
        defiling, even in a just execution, is one which may be traced
        through many ages; and executioners, as the ministers of the law,
        have been from very ancient times regarded as unholy. In both Greece
        and Rome the law compelled them to live outside the walls, and at
        Rhodes they were never permitted even to enter the city.<a id=
        "noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a> Notions
        of this kind were very strongly held in the early Church; and a
        decree of the penitential discipline which was enforced, even against
        emperors and generals, forbade any one whose hands had been imbrued
        in blood, even when that blood was shed in a righteous war,
        approaching the altar without a preparatory period of penance. The
        opinions of the Christians of the first three centuries were usually
        formed without any regard to the necessities of civil or political
        life; but when the Church obtained an ascendancy, it was found
        necessary speedily to modify them; and although Lactantius, in the
        fourth century, maintained the unlawfulness of all bloodshed,<a id=
        "noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a> as
        strongly as Origen in the third, and Tertullian in the second, the
        common doctrine was simply that no priest or bishop must take any
        part in a capital charge. From this exceptional position of the
        clergy they speedily acquired the position of official intercessors
        for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name=
        "Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> criminals, ambassadors
        of mercy, when, from some act of sedition or other cause, their city
        or neighbourhood was menaced with a bloody invasion. The right of
        sanctuary, which was before possessed by the Imperial statues and by
        the Pagan temples, was accorded to the churches. During the holy
        seasons of Lent and Easter, no criminal trials could be held, and no
        criminal could be tortured or executed.<a id="noteref_67" name=
        "noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a>
        Miracles, it was said, were sometimes wrought to attest the innocence
        of accused or condemned men, but were never wrought to consign
        criminals to execution by the civil power.<a id="noteref_68" name=
        "noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this had an
        importance much beyond its immediate effect in tempering the
        administration of the law. It contributed largely to associate in the
        popular imagination the ideas of sanctity and of mercy, and to
        increase the reverence for human life. It had also another remarkable
        effect, to which I have adverted in another work. The belief that it
        was wrong for a priest to bring any charge that could give rise to a
        capital sentence caused the leading clergy to shrink from persecuting
        heresy to death, at a time when in all other respects the theory of
        persecution had been fully matured. When it was readily admitted that
        heresy was in the highest degree criminal, and ought to be made
        penal, when laws banishing, fining, or imprisoning heretics filled
        the statute-book, and when every vestige of religious liberty was
        suppressed at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg
        041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        instigation of the clergy, these still shrank from the last and
        inevitable step, not because it was an atrocious violation of the
        rights of conscience, but because it was contrary to the
        ecclesiastical discipline for a bishop, under any circumstances, to
        countenance bloodshed. It was on this ground that St. Augustine,
        while eagerly advocating the persecution of the Donatists, more than
        once expressed a wish that they should not be punished with death,
        and that St. Ambrose, and St. Martin of Tours, who were both
        energetic persecutors, expressed their abhorrence of the Spanish
        bishops, who had caused some Priscillianists to be executed. I have
        elsewhere noticed the odious hypocrisy of the later inquisitors, who
        relegated the execution of the sentence to the civil power, with a
        prayer that the heretics should be punished <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“as mildly as possible and without the effusion of
        blood,”</span><a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href=
        "#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> which
        came at last to be interpreted, by the death of fire; but I may here
        add, that this hideous mockery is not unique in the history of
        religion. Plutarch suggests that one of the reasons for burying
        unchaste vestals alive was that they were so sacred that it was
        unlawful to lay violent hands upon them,<a id="noteref_70" name=
        "noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a> and
        among the Donatists the Circumcelliones were for a time accustomed to
        abstain, in obedience to the evangelical command, from the use of the
        sword, while they beat to death those who differed from their
        theological opinions with massive clubs, to which they gave the very
        significant name of Israelites.<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71"
        href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The time came when
        the Christian priests shed blood enough. The extreme scrupulosity,
        however, which they at first displayed, is not only exceedingly
        curious when contrasted with their later history; it was also, by the
        association of ideas which it promoted, very favourable to humanity.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042"
        id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> It is remarkable, however,
        that while some of the early Fathers were the undoubted precursors of
        Beccaria, their teaching, unlike that of the philosophers in the
        eighteenth century, had little or no appreciable influence in
        mitigating the severity of the penal code. Indeed, the more carefully
        the Christian legislation of the Empire is examined, and the more
        fully it is compared with what had been done under the influence of
        Stoicism by the Pagan legislators, the more evident, I think, it will
        appear that the golden age of Roman law was not Christian, but Pagan.
        Great works of codification were accomplished under the younger
        Theodosius, and under Justinian; but it was in the reign of Pagan
        emperors, and especially of Hadrian and Alexander Severus, that
        nearly all the most important measures were taken, redressing
        injustices, elevating oppressed classes, and making the doctrine of
        the natural equality and fraternity of mankind the basis of legal
        enactments. Receiving the heritage of these laws, the Christians, no
        doubt, added something; but a careful examination will show that it
        was surprisingly little. In no respect is the greatness of the Stoic
        philosophers more conspicuous than in the contrast between the
        gigantic steps of legal reform made in a few years under their
        influence, and the almost insignificant steps taken when Christianity
        had obtained an ascendancy in the Empire, not to speak of the long
        period of decrepitude that followed. In the way of mitigating the
        severity of punishments, Constantine made, it is true, three
        important laws prohibiting the custom of branding criminals upon the
        face, the condemnation of criminals as gladiators, and the
        continuance of the once degrading but now sacred punishment of
        crucifixion, which had been very commonly employed; but these
        measures were more than counterbalanced by the extreme severity with
        which the Christian emperors punished infanticide, adultery,
        seduction, rape, and several other crimes, and the number of capital
        offences became considerably greater <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a> The most
        prominent evidence, indeed, of ecclesiastical influence in the
        Theodosian code is that which must be most lamented. It is the
        immense mass of legislation, intended on the one hand to elevate the
        clergy into a separate and sacred caste, and on the other to
        persecute in every form, and with every degree of violence, all who
        deviated from the fine line of Catholic orthodoxy.<a id="noteref_73"
        name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last
        consequence of the Christian estimate of human life was a very
        emphatic condemnation of suicide. We have already seen that the
        arguments of the Pagan moralists, who were opposed to this act, were
        of four kinds. The religious argument of Pythagoras and Plato was,
        that we are all soldiers of God, placed in an appointed post of duty,
        which it is a rebellion against our Maker to desert. The civic
        argument of Aristotle and the Greek legislators was that we owe our
        services to the State, and that therefore voluntarily to abandon life
        is to abandon our duty to our country. The argument which Plutarch
        and other writers derived from human dignity was that true courage is
        shown in the manful endurance of suffering, while suicide, being an
        act of flight, is an act of cowardice, and therefore unworthy of man.
        The mystical or Quietist argument of the Neoplatonists was that all
        perturbation is a pollution of the soul; that the act of suicide is
        accompanied by, and springs from, perturbation, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and that therefore the perpetrator ends
        his days by a crime. Of these four arguments, the last cannot, I
        think, be said to have had any place among the Christian dissuasives
        from suicide, and the influence of the second was almost
        imperceptible. The notion of patriotism being a moral duty was
        habitually discouraged in the early Church; and it was impossible to
        urge the civic argument against suicide without at the same time
        condemning the hermit life, which in the third century became the
        ideal of the Church. The duty a man owes to his family, which a
        modern moralist would deem the most obvious and, perhaps, the most
        conclusive proof of the general criminality of suicide, and which may
        be said to have replaced the civic argument, was scarcely noticed
        either by the Pagans or the early Christians. The first were
        accustomed to lay so much stress upon the authority, that they
        scarcely recognised the duties, of the father; and the latter were
        too anxious to attach all their ethics to the interests of another
        world, to do much to supply the omission. The Christian estimate of
        the duty of humility, and of the degradation of man, rendered appeals
        to human dignity somewhat uncongenial to the patristic writers; yet
        these writers frequently dilated upon the true courage of patience,
        in language to which their own heroism under persecution gave a noble
        emphasis. To the example of Cato they opposed those of Regulus and
        Job, the courage that endures suffering to the courage that confronts
        death. The Platonic doctrine, that we are servants of the Deity,
        placed upon earth to perform our allotted task in His sight, with His
        assistance, and by His will, they continually enforced and most
        deeply realised; and this doctrine was in itself, in most cases, a
        sufficient preventive; for, as a great writer has said: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Though there are many crimes of a deeper dye than
        suicide, there is no other by which men appear so formally to
        renounce the protection of God.”</span><a id="noteref_74" name=
        "noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, in addition
        to this general teaching, the Christian theologians introduced into
        the sphere we are considering new elements both of terrorism and of
        persuasion, which have had a decisive influence upon the judgments of
        mankind. They carried their doctrine of the sanctity of human life to
        such a point that they maintained dogmatically that a man who
        destroys his own life has committed a crime similar both in kind and
        magnitude to that of an ordinary murderer,<a id="noteref_75" name=
        "noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a> and they
        at the same time gave a new character to death by their doctrines
        concerning its penal nature and concerning the future destinies of
        the soul. On the other hand, the high position assigned to
        resignation in the moral scale, the hope of future happiness, which
        casts a ray of light upon the darkest calamities of life, the deeper
        and more subtle consolations arising from the feeling of trust and
        from the outpouring of prayer, and, above all, the Christian doctrine
        of the remedial and providential character of suffering, have proved
        sufficient protection against despair. The Christian doctrine, that
        pain is a good, had in this respect an influence that was never
        attained by the Pagan doctrine, that pain is not an evil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were,
        however, two forms of suicide which were regarded in the early Church
        with some tolerance or hesitation. During the frenzy excited by
        persecution, and under the influence of the belief that martyrdom
        effaced in a moment the sins of a life, and introduced the sufferer
        at once into celestial joys, it was not uncommon for men, in a
        transport of enthusiasm, to rush before the Pagan judges, imploring
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046"
        id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or provoking martyrdom; and
        some of the ecclesiastical writers have spoken of these men with
        considerable admiration,<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href=
        "#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> though
        the general tone of the patristic writings and the councils of the
        Church condemned them. A more serious difficulty arose about
        Christian women who committed suicide to guard their chastity when
        menaced by the infamous sentences of their persecutors, or more
        frequently by the lust of emperors, or by barbarian invaders. St.
        Pelagia, a girl of only fifteen, who has been canonised by the
        Church, and who was warmly eulogised by St. Ambrose and St.
        Chrysostom, having been captured by the soldiery, obtained permission
        to retire to her room for the purpose of robing herself, mounted to
        the roof of the house, and, flinging herself down, perished by the
        fall.<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href=
        "#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> A
        Christian lady of Antioch, named Domnina, had two daughters renowned
        alike for their beauty and their piety. Being captured during the
        Diocletian persecution, and fearing the loss of their chastity, they
        agreed by one bold act to free themselves from the danger, and,
        casting themselves into a river by the way, mother and daughters sank
        unsullied in the wave.<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href=

        tyrant, the faithful wife obtained permission, before yielding to her
        master's embraces, to retire for a moment into her chamber, and she
        there, with true Roman courage, stabbed herself to the heart.<a id=

        with which the early ecclesiastical writers narrate these histories.
        To those who have not suffered theological opinions to destroy all
        their natural sense of nobility it will need no defence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was the only
        form of avowed suicide which was in any degree permitted in the early
        Church. St. Ambrose rather timidly, and St. Jerome more strongly,
        commended it; but at the time when the capture of Rome by the
        soldiers of Alaric made the question one of pressing interest, St.
        Augustine devoted an elaborate examination to the subject, and while
        expressing his pitying admiration for the virgin suicides, decidedly
        condemned their act.<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href=
        "#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> His
        opinion of the absolute sinfulness of suicide has since been
        generally adopted by the Catholic theologians, who pretend that
        Pelagia and Domnina acted under the impulse of a special
        revelation.<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href=
        "#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> inconsistency, no characters were more
        enthusiastically extolled than those anchorites who habitually
        deprived their bodies of the sustenance that was absolutely necessary
        to health, and thus manifestly abridged their lives. St. Jerome has
        preserved a curious illustration of the feeling with which these slow
        suicides were regarded by the outer world, in his account of the life
        and death of a young nun named Blesilla. This lady had been guilty of
        what, according to the religious notions of the fourth century, was,
        at least, the frivolity of marrying, but was left a widow seven
        months afterwards, having thus <span class="tei tei-q">“lost at once
        the crown of virginity and the pleasure of marriage.”</span><a id=

        attack of illness inspired her with strong religious feelings. At the
        age of twenty she retired to a convent. She attained such a height of
        devotion that, according to the very characteristic eulogy of her
        biographer, <span class="tei tei-q">“she was more sorry for the loss
        of her virginity than for the decease of her husband;”</span><a id=

        long succession of atrocious penances preceded, if they did not
        produce, her death.<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href=
        "#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a> The
        conviction that she had been killed by fasting, and the spectacle of
        the uncontrollable grief of her mother, filled the populace with
        indignation, and the funeral was disturbed by tumultuous cries that
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“accursed race of monks should be
        banished from the city, stoned, or drowned.”</span><a id="noteref_86"

        Church itself, however, we find very few traces of any condemnation
        of the custom of undermining the constitution by austerities,<a id=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> what is related of the habits of the early and
        mediæval monks, great numbers of them must have thus shortened their
        days. There is a touching story told by St. Bonaventura, of St.
        Francis Assisi, who was one of these victims to asceticism. As the
        dying saint sank back exhausted with spitting blood, he avowed, as he
        looked upon his emaciated body, that <span class="tei tei-q">“he had
        sinned against his brother, the ass;”</span> and then, the feeling of
        his mind taking, as was usual with him, the form of an hallucination,
        he imagined that, when at prayer during the night, he heard a voice
        saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“Francis, there is no sinner in the
        world whom, if he be converted, God will not pardon; but he who kills
        himself by hard penances will find no mercy in eternity.”</span> He
        attributed the voice to the devil.<a id="noteref_88" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Direct and
        deliberate suicide, which occupies so prominent a place in the moral
        history of antiquity, almost absolutely disappeared within the
        Church; but beyond its pale the Circumcelliones, in the fourth
        century, constituted themselves the apostles of death, and not only
        carried to the highest point the custom of provoking martyrdom, by
        challenging and insulting the assemblies of the Pagans, but even
        killed themselves in great numbers, imagining, it would seem, that
        this was a form of martyrdom, and would secure for them eternal
        salvation. Assembling in hundreds, St. Augustine says even in
        thousands, they leaped with paroxysms of frantic joy from the brows
        of overhanging cliffs, till the rocks below were reddened with their
        blood.<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href=

        much later period, we find among the Albigenses a practice, known by
        the name of Endura, of accelerating death, in the case of dangerous
        illness, by fasting, and sometimes by bleeding.<a id="noteref_90"
        name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class=

        wretched Jews, stung to madness by the persecution of the Catholics,
        furnish <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name=
        "Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the most numerous
        examples of suicide during the middle ages. A multitude perished by
        their own hands, to avoid torture, in France, in 1095; five hundred,
        it is said, on a single occasion at York; five hundred in 1320, when
        besieged by the Shepherds. The old Pagan legislation on this subject
        remained unaltered in the Theodosian and Justinian codes; but a
        Council of Arles, in the fifth century, having pronounced suicide to
        be the effect of diabolical inspiration, a Council of Bragues, in the
        following century, ordained that no religious rites should be
        celebrated at the tomb of the culprit, and that no masses should be
        said for his soul; and these provisions, which were repeated by later
        Councils, were gradually introduced into the laws of the barbarians
        and of Charlemagne. St. Lewis originated the custom of confiscating
        the property of the dead man, and the corpse was soon subjected to
        gross and various outrages. In some countries it could only be
        removed from the house through a perforation specially made for the
        occasion in the wall; it was dragged upon a hurdle through the
        streets, hung up with the head downwards, and at last thrown into the
        public sewer, or burnt, or buried in the sand below high-water mark,
        or transfixed by a stake on the public highway.<a id="noteref_91"
        name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These singularly
        hideous and at the same time grotesque customs, and also the extreme
        injustice of reducing to beggary the unhappy relations of the dead,
        had the very natural effect of exciting, in the eighteenth century, a
        strong spirit of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg
        051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        reaction. Suicide is indeed one of those acts which may be condemned
        by moralists as a sin, but which, in modern times at least, cannot be
        regarded as within the legitimate sphere of law; for a society which
        accords to its members perfect liberty of emigration, cannot
        reasonably pronounce the simple renunciation of life to be an offence
        against itself. When, however, Beccaria and his followers went
        further, and maintained that the mediæval laws on the subject were as
        impotent as they were revolting, they fell, I think, into serious
        error. The outrages lavished upon the corpse of the suicide, though
        in the first instance an expression of the popular horror of his act,
        contributed, by the associations they formed, to strengthen the
        feeling that produced them, and they were also peculiarly fitted to
        scare the diseased, excited, and oversensitive imaginations that are
        most prone to suicide. In the rare occasions when the act was
        deliberately contemplated, the knowledge that religious, legislative,
        and social influences would combine to aggravate to the utmost the
        agony of the surviving relatives, must have had great weight. The
        activity of the Legislature shows the continuance of the act; but we
        have every reason to believe that within the pale of Catholicism it
        was for many centuries extremely rare. It is said to have been
        somewhat prevalent in Spain in the last and most corrupt period of
        the Gothic kingdom,<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href=
        "#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a> and many
        instances occurred during a great pestilence which raged in England
        in the seventh century,<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href=
        "#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        women it was in general especially rare; and a learned historian of
        suicide has even asserted that a Spanish lady, who, being separated
        from her husband, and finding herself unable to resist the energy of
        her passions, killed herself rather than yield to temptation, is the
        only instance of female suicide during several centuries.<a id=

        criminality was discussed at considerable length by Abelard and St.
        Thomas Aquinas, while Dante has devoted some fine lines to painting
        the condition of suicides in hell, where they are also frequently
        represented in the bas-reliefs of cathedrals. A melancholy leading to
        desperation, and known to theologians under the name of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“acedia,”</span> was not uncommon in monasteries, and
        most of the recorded instances of mediæval suicides in Catholicism
        were by monks. The frequent suicides of monks, sometimes to escape
        the world, sometimes through despair at their inability to quell the
        propensities of the body, sometimes through insanity produced by
        their mode of life, and by their dread of surrounding demons, were
        noticed in the early Church,<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98"

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        suicides produced by the bitterness of hopeless love, or by the
        derangement that follows extreme austerity. These are, however, but
        few; and it is probable that the monasteries, by providing a refuge
        for the disappointed and the broken-hearted, have prevented more
        suicides than they have caused, and that, during the whole period of
        Catholic ascendancy, the act was more rare than before or after. The
        influence of Catholicism was seconded by Mohammedanism, which, on
        this as on many other points, borrowed its teaching from the
        Christian Church, and even intensified it; for suicide, which is
        never expressly condemned in the Bible, is more than once forbidden
        in the Koran, and the Christian duty of resignation was exaggerated
        by the Moslem into a complete fatalism. Under the empire of
        Catholicism and Mohammedanism, suicide, during many centuries, almost
        absolutely ceased in all the civilised, active, and progressive part
        of mankind. When we recollect how warmly it was applauded, or how
        faintly it was condemned, in the civilisation of Greece and Rome;
        when we remember, too, that there was scarcely a barbarous tribe,
        from Denmark to Spain, who did not habitually practise it,<a id=

        revolution which was effected in this sphere by the influence of
        Christianity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few words may be
        added on the later phases of this mournful history. The Reformation
        does not seem to have had any immediate effect in multiplying
        suicide, for Protestants and Catholics held with equal intensity the
        religious sentiments which are most fitted to prevent it, and in none
        of the persecutions was impatience of life largely displayed. The
        history at this period passes chiefly into the new world, where the
        unhappy Indians, reduced to slavery, and treated with atrocious
        cruelty by their conquerors, killed themselves in great numbers; till
        the Spaniards, it is said, discovered an ingenious method of
        deterring them, by declaring that the master also would commit
        suicide, and would pursue his victims into the world of
        spirits.<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href=
        "#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a> In
        Europe the act was very common among the witches, who underwent all
        the sufferings with none of the consolations of martyrdom. Without
        enthusiasm, without hope, without even the consciousness of
        innocence, decrepit in body, and distracted in mind, compelled in
        this world to endure tortures, before which the most impassioned
        heroism might quail, and doomed, as they often believed, to eternal
        damnation in the next, they not unfrequently killed themselves in the
        agony of their despair. A French judge named Remy tells us that he
        knew no less than fifteen witches commit suicide in a single
        year.<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href=
        "#note_102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> In these cases, fear and
        madness combined in urging the victims to the deed. Epidemics of
        purely insane suicide have also not unfrequently occurred. Both the
        women of Marseilles and the women of Lyons were afflicted with an
        epidemic not unlike that which, in antiquity, had been noticed among
        the girls of Miletus.<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href=
        "#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a> In that
        strange mania which raged in the Neapolitan districts from the end of
        the fifteenth to the end of the seventeenth century, and which was
        attributed to the bite of the tarantula, the patients thronged in
        multitudes towards the sea, and often, as the blue waters opened to
        their view, they chanted a wild hymn of welcome, and rushed with
        passion into the waves.<a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href=
        "#note_104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        together with these cases, which belong rather to the history of
        medicine than to that of morals, we find many facts exhibiting a
        startling increase of deliberate suicide, and a no less startling
        modification of the sentiments with which it was regarded. The
        revival of classical learning, and the growing custom of regarding
        Greek and Roman heroes as ideals, necessarily brought the subject
        into prominence. The Catholic casuists, and at a later period
        philosophers of the school of Grotius and Puffendorf, began to
        distinguish certain cases of legitimate suicide, such as that
        committed to avoid dishonour or probable sin, or that of the soldier
        who fires a mine, knowing he must inevitably perish by the explosion,
        or that of a condemned person who saves himself from torture by
        anticipating an inevitable fate, or that of a man who offers himself
        to death for his friend.<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href=

        Pagan examples may frequently be detected in the last words or
        writings of the suicides. Philip Strozzi, when accused of the
        assassination of Alexander I. of Tuscany, killed himself through fear
        that torture might extort from him revelations injurious to his
        friends, and he left behind him a paper in which, among other things,
        he commended his soul to God, with the prayer that, if no higher boon
        could be granted, he might at least be permitted to have his place
        with Cato of Utica and the other great suicides of antiquity.<a id=

        England, the act appears in the seventeenth century and in the first
        half of the eighteenth to have been more common than upon the
        Continent,<a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href=

        several partial or even unqualified apologies for it were written.
        Sir Thomas More, in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Utopia,”</span>
        represented the priests and magistrates of his ideal republic
        permitting or even enjoining those who were afflicted with incurable
        disease to kill themselves, but depriving of burial those who had
        done so without authorisation.<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108"

        Donne, the learned and pious Dean of St. Paul's, had in his youth
        written an extremely curious, subtle, and learned, but at the same
        time feeble and involved, work in defence of suicide, which on his
        deathbed he commanded his son neither to publish nor destroy, and
        which his son published in 1644. Two or three English suicides left
        behind them elaborate defences, as did also a Swede named Robeck, who
        drowned himself in 1735, and whose treatise, published in the
        following year, acquired considerable celebrity.<a id="noteref_109"

        id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the most influential writings
        about suicide were those of the French philosophers and
        revolutionists. Montaigne, without discussing its abstract
        lawfulness, recounts, with much admiration, many of the instances in
        antiquity.<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href=

        Montesquieu, in a youthful work, defended it with ardent
        enthusiasm.<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href=

        Rousseau devoted to the subject two letters of a burning and
        passionate eloquence,<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href=
        "#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        first of which he presented with matchless power the arguments in its
        favour, while in the second he denounced those arguments as
        sophistical, dilated upon the impiety of abandoning the post of duty,
        and upon the cowardice of despair, and with a deep knowledge of the
        human heart revealed the selfishness that lies at the root of most
        suicide, exhorting all who felt impelled to it to set about some work
        for the good of others, in which they would assuredly find relief.
        Voltaire, in the best-known couplet he ever wrote, defends the act on
        occasions of extreme necessity.<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113"
        href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a> Among
        the atheistical party it was warmly eulogised, and Holbach and
        Deslandes were prominent as its defenders. The rapid decomposition of
        religious opinions weakened the popular sense of its enormity, and at
        the same time the humanity of the age, and also a clearer sense of
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name=
        "Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> true limits of
        legislation, produced a reaction against the horrible laws on the
        subject. Grotius had defended them. Montesquieu at first denounced
        them with unqualified energy, but in his later years in some degree
        modified his opinions. Beccaria, who was, more than any other writer,
        the representative of the opinions of the French school on such
        matters, condemned them partly as unjust to the innocent survivors,
        partly as incapable of deterring any man who was resolved upon the
        act. Even in 1749, in the full blaze of the philosophic movement, we
        find a suicide named Portier dragged through the streets of Paris
        with his face to the ground, hung from a gallows by his feet, and
        then thrown into the sewers;<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114"
        href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a> and the
        laws were not abrogated till the Revolution, which, having founded so
        many other forms of freedom, accorded the liberty of death. Amid the
        dramatic vicissitudes, and the fierce enthusiasm of that period of
        convulsions, suicides immediately multiplied. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The world,”</span> it was said, had been <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“empty since the Romans.”</span><a id="noteref_115" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a> For a
        brief period, and in this one country, the action of Christianity
        appeared suspended. Men seemed to be transported again into the age
        of Paganism, and the suicides, though more theatrical, were
        perpetrated with no less deliberation, and eulogised with no less
        enthusiasm, than among the Stoics. But the tide of revolution passed
        away, and with some qualifications the old opinions resumed their
        authority. The laws against suicide were, indeed, for the most part
        abolished. In France and several other lands there exists no
        legislation on the subject. In other countries the law simply enjoins
        burial without religious ceremonies. In England, the burial in a
        highway and the mutilation by a stake were abolished under George
        IV.; but the monstrous injustice of confiscating to the Crown the
        entire property of the deliberate suicide still <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> disgraces the statute-book, though the
        force of public opinion and the charitable perjury of juries render
        it inoperative.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The common
        sentiment of Christendom has, however, ratified the judgment which
        the Christian teachers pronounced upon the act, though it has
        somewhat modified the severity of the old censure, and has abandoned
        some of the old arguments. It was reserved for Madame de Staël, who,
        in a youthful work upon the Passions, had commended suicide, to
        reconstruct this department of ethics, which had been somewhat
        disturbed by the Revolution, and she did so in a little treatise
        which is a model of calm, candid, and philosophic piety. Frankly
        abandoning the old theological notions that the deed is of the nature
        of murder, that it is the worst of crimes, and that it is always, or
        even generally, the offspring of cowardice; abandoning, too, all
        attempts to scare men by religious terrorism, she proceeded, not so
        much to meet in detail the isolated arguments of its defenders, as to
        sketch the ideal of a truly virtuous man, and to show how such a
        character would secure men against all temptation to suicide. In
        pages of the most tender beauty, she traced the influence of
        suffering in softening, purifying, and deepening the character, and
        showed how a frame of habitual and submissive resignation was not
        only the highest duty, but also the source of the purest consolation,
        and at the same time the appointed condition of moral amelioration.
        Having examined in detail the Biblical aspect of the question, she
        proceeded to show how the true measure of the dignity of man is his
        unselfishness. She contrasted the martyr with the suicide—the death
        which springs from devotion to duty with the death that springs from
        rebellion against circumstances. The suicide of Cato, which had been
        absurdly denounced by a crowd of ecclesiastics as an act of
        cowardice, and as absurdly alleged by many suicides as a
        justification for flying from pain or poverty, she represented as an
        act of martyrdom—a death like that of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Curtius, accepted nobly for the benefit of
        Rome. The eye of the good man should be for ever fixed upon the
        interest of others. For them he should be prepared to relinquish life
        with all its blessings. For them he should be prepared to tolerate
        life, even when it seemed to him a curse.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sentiments of this
        kind have, through the influence of Christianity, thoroughly pervaded
        European society, and suicide, in modern times, is almost always
        found to have sprung either from absolute insanity; from diseases
        which, though not amounting to insanity, are yet sufficient to
        discolour our judgments; or from that last excess of sorrow, when
        resignation and hope are both extinct. Considering it in this light,
        I know few things more fitted to qualify the optimism we so often
        hear than the fact that statistics show it to be rapidly increasing,
        and to be peculiarly characteristic of those nations which rank most
        high in intellectual development and in general civilisation.<a id=
        "noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href="#note_116"><span class=

        or two countries, strong religious feeling has counteracted the
        tendency; but the comparison of town and country, of different
        countries, of different provinces of the same country, and of
        different periods in history, proves conclusively its reality. Many
        reasons may be alleged to explain it. Mental occupations are
        peculiarly fitted to produce insanity,<a id="noteref_117" name=
        "noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a> and the
        blaze of publicity, which in modern time encircles an act of suicide,
        to draw weak minds to its imitation. If we put the condition of
        absolutely savage life, out of our calculation, it is probable that a
        highly developed civilisation, while it raises the average of
        well-being, is accompanied by more extreme misery and acute
        sufferings <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg
        061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        than the simpler stages that had preceded it. Nomadic habits, the
        vast agglomeration of men in cities, the pressure of a fierce
        competition, and the sudden fluctuations to which manufactures are
        peculiarly liable, are the conditions of great prosperity, but also
        the causes of the most profound misery. Civilisation makes many of
        what once were superfluities, necessaries of life, so that their loss
        inflicts a pang long after their possession had ceased to be a
        pleasure. It also, by softening the character, renders it peculiarly
        sensitive to pain, and it brings with it a long train of antipathies,
        passions, and diseased imaginations, which rarely or never cross the
        thoughts or torture the nerves of the simple peasant. The advance of
        religious scepticism, and the relaxation of religious discipline,
        have weakened and sometimes destroyed the horror of suicide; and the
        habits of self-assertion, the eager and restless ambitions which
        political liberty, intellectual activity, and manufacturing
        enterprise, all in their different ways conspire to foster, while
        they are the very principles and conditions of the progress of our
        age, render the virtue of content in all its forms extremely rare,
        and are peculiarly unpropitious to the formation of that spirit of
        humble and submissive resignation which alone can mitigate the agony
        of hopeless suffering.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From examining the
        effect of Christianity in promoting a sense of the sanctity of human
        life, we may now pass to an adjoining field, and examine its
        influence in promoting a fraternal and philanthropic sentiment among
        mankind. And first of all we may notice its effects upon slavery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reader will
        remember the general position this institution occupied in the eyes
        of the Stoic moralists, and under the legislation which they had in a
        great measure inspired. The legitimacy of slavery was fully
        recognised; but Seneca and other moralists had asserted, in the very
        strongest terms, the natural equality of mankind, the superficial
        character of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg
        062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        differences between the slave and his master, and the duty of the
        most scrupulous humanity to the former. Instances of a very warm
        sympathy between master and slave were of frequent occurrence; but
        they may unfortunately be paralleled by not a few examples of the
        most atrocious cruelty. To guard against such cruelty, a long series
        of enactments, based avowedly upon the Stoical principle of the
        essential equality of mankind, had been made under Hadrian, the
        Antonines, and Alexander Severus. Not to recapitulate at length what
        has been mentioned in a former chapter, it is sufficient to remind
        the reader that the right of life and death had been definitely
        withdrawn from the master, and that the murder of a slave was
        stigmatised and punished by the law. It had, however, been laid down,
        by the great lawyer Paul, that homicide implies an intention to kill,
        and that therefore the master was not guilty of that crime if his
        slave died under chastisement which was not administered with this
        intention. But the licence of punishment which this decision might
        give was checked by laws which forbade excessive cruelty to slaves,
        provided that, when it was proved, they should be sold to another
        master, suppressed the private prisons in which they had been
        immured, and appointed special officers to receive their
        complaints.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the field of
        legislation, for about two hundred years after the conversion of
        Constantine, the progress was extremely slight. The Christian
        emperors, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 319 and 326, adverted

        beyond reiterating in very emphatic terms the previous enactments, it
        is not easy to see in what way they improved the condition of the
        class.<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href=
        "#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        that any master who applied to his slave certain atrocious tortures,
        that are enumerated, with the object of killing him, should be deemed
        a homicide, but if the slave died under moderate punishment, or under
        any punishment not intended to kill him, the master should be
        blameless; no charge whatever, it was emphatically said, should be
        brought against him. It has been supposed, though I think without
        evidence, by commentators<a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href=
        "#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a> that
        this law accorded immunity to the master only when the slave perished
        under the application of <span class="tei tei-q">“appropriate”</span>
        or servile punishments—that is to say, scourging, irons, or
        imprisonment; but the use of torture not intended to kill was in no
        degree restricted, nor is there anything in the law to make it appear
        either that the master was liable to punishment, if contrary to his
        intention his slave succumbed beneath torture, or that Constantine
        proposed any penalty for excessive cruelty which did not result in
        death. It is, perhaps, not out of place to observe, that this law was
        in remarkable harmony with the well-known article of the Jewish code,
        which provided that if a slave, wounded to death by his master,
        linger for a day or two, the master should not be punished, for the
        slave was his money.<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two features
        that were most revolting in the slave system, as it passed from the
        Pagan to the Christian emperors, were the absolute want of legal
        recognition of slave marriage, and the licence of torturing still
        conceded to the master. The Christian emperors before Justinian took
        no serious steps to remedy either of these evils, and the measures
        that were taken against adultery still continued inapplicable to
        slave unions, because <span class="tei tei-q">“the vileness of their
        condition makes them unworthy of the observation of the
        law.”</span><a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href=

        abolition of the punishment of crucifixion had, however, a special
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064"
        id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> value to the slave class, and
        a very merciful law of Constantine forbade the separation of the
        families of the slaves.<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href=
        "#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a> Another
        law, which in its effects was perhaps still more important, imparted
        a sacred character to manumission, ordaining that the ceremony should
        be celebrated in the Church,<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124"
        href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a> and
        permitting it on Sundays. Some measures were also taken, providing
        for the freedom of the Christian slaves of Jewish masters, and, in
        two or three cases, freedom was offered as a bribe to slaves, to
        induce them to inform against criminals. Intermarriage between the
        free and slave classes was still strictly forbidden, and if a free
        woman had improper intercourse with her slave, Constantine ordered
        that the woman should be executed and the slave burnt alive.<a id=
        "noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href="#note_125"><span class=

        Pagan law, the woman had been simply reduced to slavery. The laws
        against fugitive slaves were also rendered more severe.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This legislation
        may on the whole be looked upon as a progress, but it certainly does
        not deserve the enthusiasm which ecclesiastical writers have
        sometimes bestowed upon it. For about two hundred years, there was an
        almost absolute pause in the legislation on this subject. Some slight
        restrictions were, however, imposed upon the use of torture in
        trials; some slight additional facilities of manumission were given,
        and some very atrocious enactments made to prevent slaves accusing
        their masters. According to that of Gratian, any slave who accused
        his master of any offence, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg
        065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        except high treason, should immediately be burnt alive, without any
        investigation of the justice of the charge.<a id="noteref_127" name=
        "noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under Justinian,
        however, new and very important measures were taken. In no other
        sphere were the laws of this emperor so indisputably an advance upon
        those of his predecessors. His measures may be comprised under three
        heads. In the first place, all the restrictions upon enfranchisement
        which had accumulated under the Pagan legislation were abolished; the
        legislator proclaimed in emphatic language, and by the provisions of
        many laws, his desire to encourage manumission, and free scope was
        thus given to the action of the Church. In the second place, the
        freedmen, considered as an intermediate class between the slave and
        the citizen, were virtually abolished, all or nearly all the
        privileges accorded to the citizen being granted to the emancipated
        slave. This was the most important contribution of the Christian
        emperors to that great amalgamation of nations and classes which had
        been advancing since the days of Augustus; and one of its effects
        was, that any person, even of senatorial rank, might marry a slave
        when he had first emancipated her. In the third place, a slave was
        permitted to marry a free woman with the authorisation of his master,
        and children born in slavery became the legal heirs of their
        emancipated father. The rape of a slave woman was also in this reign
        punished, like that of a free woman, by death.<a id="noteref_128"
        name="noteref_128" href="#note_128"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, important as
        were these measures, it is not in the field of legislation that we
        must chiefly look for the influence of Christianity upon slavery.
        This influence was indeed very great, but it is necessary carefully
        to define its nature. The prohibition of all slavery, which was one
        of the peculiarities of the Jewish Essenes, and the illegitimacy of
        hereditary <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg
        066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        slavery, which was one of the speculations of the Stoic Dion
        Chrysostom, had no place in the ecclesiastical teaching. Slavery was
        distinctly and formally recognised by Christianity,<a id=
        "noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href="#note_129"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a> and no
        religion ever laboured more to encourage a habit of docility and
        passive obedience. Much was indeed said by the Fathers about the
        natural equality of mankind, about the duty of regarding slaves as
        brothers or companions, and about the heinousness of cruelty to them;
        but all this had been said with at least equal force, though it had
        not been disseminated over an equally wide area, by Seneca and
        Epictetus, and the principle of the original freedom of all men was
        repeatedly averred by the Pagan lawyers. The services of Christianity
        in this sphere were of three kinds. It supplied a new order of
        relations, in which the distinction of classes was unknown. It
        imparted a moral dignity to the servile classes, and it gave an
        unexampled impetus to the movement of enfranchisement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first of these
        services was effected by the Church ceremonies and the penitential
        discipline. In these spheres, from which the Christian mind derived
        its earliest, its deepest, and its most enduring impressions, the
        difference between the master and his slave was unknown. They
        received the sacred elements together, they sat side by side at the
        agape, they mingled in the public prayers. In the penal system of the
        Church, the distinction between wrongs done to a freeman, and wrongs
        done to a slave, which lay at the very root of the whole civil
        legislation, was repudiated. At a time when, by the civil law, a
        master, whose slave died as a consequence of excessive scourging, was
        absolutely unpunished, the Council of Illiberis excluded that master
        for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name=
        "Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ever from the
        communion.<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href=
        "#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a> The
        chastity of female slaves, for the protection of which the civil law
        made but little provision, was sedulously guarded by the legislation
        of the Church. Slave birth, moreover, was no disqualification for
        entering into the priesthood; and an emancipated slave, regarded as
        the dispenser of spiritual life and death, often saw the greatest and
        the most wealthy kneeling humbly at his feet imploring his absolution
        or his benediction.<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href=
        "#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the next place,
        Christianity imparted a moral dignity to the servile class. It did
        this not only by associating poverty and labour with that monastic
        life which was so profoundly revered, but also by introducing new
        modifications into the ideal type of morals. There is no fact more
        prominent in the Roman writers than the profound contempt with which
        they regarded slaves, not so much on account of their position, as on
        account of the character which that position had formed. A servile
        character was a synonym for a vicious one. Cicero had declared that
        nothing great or noble could exist in a slave, and the plays of
        Plautus exhibit the same estimate in every scene. There were, it is
        true, some exceptions. Epictetus had not only been, but had been
        recognised as one of the noblest characters of Rome. The fidelity of
        slaves to their masters had been frequently extolled, and Seneca in
        this, as in other respects, had been the defender of the oppressed.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068"
        id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Still there can be no doubt
        that this contempt was general, and also that in the Pagan world it
        was to a great extent just. Every age has its own moral ideal, to
        which all virtuous men aspire. Every sphere of life has also a
        tendency to produce a distinctive type being specially favourable to
        some particular class of virtues, and specially unfavourable to
        others. The popular estimate, and even the real moral condition, of
        each class depends chiefly upon the degree in which the type of
        character its position naturally develops, coincides with the ideal
        type of the age. Now, if we remember that magnanimity, self-reliance,
        dignity, independence, and, in a word, elevation of character,
        constituted the Roman ideal of perfection, it will appear evident
        that this was preeminently the type of freemen, and that the
        condition of slavery was in the very highest degree unfavourable to
        its development. Christianity for the first time gave the servile
        virtues the foremost place in the moral type. Humility, obedience,
        gentleness, patience, resignation, are all cardinal or rudimentary
        virtues in the Christian character; they were all neglected or
        underrated by the Pagans; they can all expand and flourish in a
        servile position.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The influence of
        Christianity upon slavery, by inclining the moral type to the servile
        classes, though less obvious and less discussed than some others, is,
        I believe, in the very highest degree important. There is, probably,
        scarcely any other single circumstance that exercises so profound an
        influence upon the social and political relations of a religion, as
        the class type with which it can most readily assimilate; or, in
        other words, the group or variety of virtues to which it gives the
        foremost place. The virtues that are most suited to the servile
        position were in general so little honoured by antiquity that they
        were not even cultivated in their appropriate sphere. The aspirations
        of good men were in a different direction. The virtue of the Stoic,
        which rose triumphantly under adversity, nearly always withered under
        degradation. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg
        069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> For
        the first time, under the influence of Christianity, a great moral
        movement passed through the servile class. The multitude of slaves
        who embraced the new faith was one of the reproaches of the Pagans;
        and the names of Blandina, Potamiæna, Eutyches, Victorinus, and
        Nereus, show how fully they shared in the sufferings and in the glory
        of martyrdom <a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132" href=
        "#note_132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a>. The
        first and grandest edifice of Byzantine architecture in Italy—the
        noble church of St. Vital, at Ravenna—was dedicated by Justinian to
        the memory of a martyred slave.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Christianity
        thus broke down the contempt with which the master had regarded his
        slaves, and planted among the latter a principle of moral
        regeneration which expanded in no other sphere with an equal
        perfection, its action in procuring the freedom of the slave was
        unceasing. The law of Constantine, which placed the ceremony under
        the superintendence of the clergy, and the many laws that gave
        special facilities of manumission to those who desired to enter the
        monasteries or the priesthood, symbolised the religious character the
        act had assumed. It was celebrated on Church festivals, especially at
        Easter; and, although it was not proclaimed a matter of duty or
        necessity, it was always regarded as one of the most acceptable modes
        of expiating past sins. St. Melania was said to have emancipated
        8,000 slaves; St. Ovidius, a rich martyr of Gaul, 5,000; Chromatius,
        a Roman prefect under Diocletian, 1,400; Hermes, a prefect in the
        reign of Trajan, 1,250.<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href=

        St. Gregory, many of the clergy at Hippo under the rule of St.
        Augustine, as well as great numbers of private individuals, freed

        recovery from sickness, on the birth of a child, at the hour of

        Numerous charters and epitaphs still record the gift of liberty to
        slaves throughout the middle ages, <span class="tei tei-q">“for the
        benefit of the soul”</span> of the donor or testator. In the
        thirteenth century, when there were no slaves to emancipate in
        France, it was usual in many churches to release caged pigeons on the
        ecclesiastical festivals, in memory of the ancient charity, and that
        prisoners might still be freed in the name of Christ.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Slavery, however,
        lasted in Europe for about 800 years after Constantine, and during
        the period with which alone this volume is concerned, although its
        character was changed and mitigated, the number of men who were
        subject to it was probably greater than in the Pagan Empire. In the
        West the barbarian conquests modified the conditions of labour in two
        directions. The cessation of the stream of barbarian captives, the
        impoverishment of great families, who had been surrounded by vast
        retinues of slaves, the general diminution of town life, and the
        barbarian habits of personal independence, checked the old form of
        slavery, while the misery and the precarious condition of the free
        peasants induced them in great numbers to barter their liberty for
        protection by the neighbouring lord.<a id="noteref_137" name=

        071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        great fortunes through excessive taxation diminished the number of
        superfluous slaves; and the fiscal system of the Byzantine Empire, by
        which agricultural slaves were taxed according to their
        employments,<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href=
        "#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        as the desire of emperors to encourage agriculture, led the
        legislators to attach the slaves permanently to the soil. In the
        course of time, almost the entire free peasantry, and the greater
        number of the old slaves, had sunk or risen into the qualified
        slavery called serfdom, which formed the basis of the great edifice
        of feudalism. Towards the end of the eighth century, the sale of
        slaves beyond their native provinces was in most countries
        prohibited.<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href=

        creation of the free cities of Italy, the custom of emancipating
        slaves who were enrolled in the army, and economical changes which
        made free labour more profitable than slave labour, conspired with
        religious motives in effecting the ultimate freedom of labour. The
        practice of manumitting, as an act of devotion, continued to the end;
        but the ecclesiastics, probably through the feeling that they had no
        right to alienate corporate property, in which they had only a life
        interest, were among the last to follow the counsels they so
        liberally bestowed upon the laity.<a id="noteref_140" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Closely connected
        with the influence of the Church in destroying hereditary slavery,
        was its influence in redeeming captives from servitude. In no other
        form of charity was its beneficial character more continually and
        more splendidly displayed. During the long and dreary trials of the
        barbarian invasions, when the whole structure of society was
        dislocated, when vast districts and mighty cities were in a few
        months almost depopulated, and when the flower of the youth of Italy
        were mown down by the sword, or carried away into captivity, the
        bishops never desisted from their efforts to alleviate the sufferings
        of the prisoners. St. Ambrose, disregarding the outcries of the
        Arians, who denounced his act as atrocious sacrilege, sold the rich
        church ornaments of Milan to rescue some captives who had fallen into
        the hands of the Goths, and this practice—which was afterwards
        formally sanctioned by St. Gregory the Great—became speedily general.
        When the Roman army had captured, but refused to support, seven
        thousand Persian prisoners, Acacius, Bishop of Amida, undeterred by
        the bitter hostility of the Persians to Christianity, and declaring
        that <span class="tei tei-q">“God had no need of plates or
        dishes,”</span> sold all the rich church ornaments of his diocese,
        rescued the unbelieving prisoners, and sent them back unharmed to
        their king. During the horrors of the Vandal invasion, Deogratias,
        Bishop of Carthage, took a similar step to ransom the Roman
        prisoners. St. Augustine, St. Gregory the Great, St. Cæsarius of
        Arles, St. Exuperius of Toulouse, St. Hilary, St. Remi, all melted
        down or sold their church vases to free prisoners. St. Cyprian sent a
        large sum for the same purpose to the Bishop of Nicomedia. St.
        Epiphanius and St. Avitus, in conjunction with a rich Gaulish lady
        named Syagria, are said to have rescued thousands. St. Eligius
        devoted to this object his entire fortune. St. Paulinus of Nola
        displayed a similar generosity, and the legends even assert, though
        untruly, that he, like St. Peter Teleonarius and St. Serapion, having
        exhausted all other forms of charity, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> as a last gift sold himself to slavery. When,
        long afterwards, the Mohammedan conquests in a measure reproduced the
        calamities of the barbarian invasions, the same unwearied charity was
        displayed. The Trinitarian monks, founded by John of Matha in the
        twelfth century, were devoted to the release of Christian captives,
        and another society was founded with the same object by Peter
        Nolasco, in the following century.<a id="noteref_142" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The different
        branches of the subject I am examining are so closely intertwined
        that it is difficult to investigate one without in a measure
        anticipating the others. While discussing the influence of the Church
        in protecting infancy, in raising the estimate of human life, and in
        alleviating slavery, I have trenched largely upon the last
        application of the doctrine of Christian fraternity I must examine—I
        mean the foundation of charity. The difference between Pagan and
        Christian societies in this matter is very profound; but a great part
        of it must be ascribed to causes other than religious opinions.
        Charity finds an extended scope for action only, where there exists a
        large class of men at once independent and impoverished. In the
        ancient societies, slavery in a great measure replaced pauperism,
        and, by securing the subsistence of a very large proportion of the
        poor, contracted the sphere of charity. And what slavery did at Rome
        for the very poor, the system of clientage did for those of a
        somewhat higher rank. The existence of these two institutions is
        sufficient to show the injustice of judging the two societies by a
        mere comparison of their charitable institutions, and we must also
        remember that among the ancients the relief of the indigent was one
        of the most important functions of the State. Not to dwell upon the
        many measures taken with this object in ancient Greece, in
        considering the condition of the Roman poor we are at once met
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074"
        id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by the simple fact that for
        several centuries the immense majority of these were habitually
        supported by gratuitous distributions of corn. In a very early period
        of Roman history we find occasional instances of distribution; but it
        was not till <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.u.c.</span></span> 630 that Caius
        Gracchus caused a law to be made, supplying the poorer classes with
        corn at a price that was little more than nominal; and although, two
        years after, the nobles succeeded in revoking this law, it was after
        several fluctuations finally re-enacted in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.u.c.</span></span> 679. The
        Cassia-Terentia law, as it was called from the consuls under whom it
        was at last established, was largely extended in its operation, or,
        as some think, revived from neglect in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.u.c.</span></span> 691, by Cato of
        Utica, who desired by this means to divert popularity from the cause
        of Cæsar, under whom multitudes of the poor were enrolling
        themselves. Four years later, Clodius Pulcher, abolishing the small
        payment which had been demanded, made the distribution entirely
        gratuitous. It took place once a month, and consisted of five
        modii<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href=
        "#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a> a head.
        In the time of Julius Cæsar no less than 320,000 persons were
        inscribed as recipients; but Cæsar reduced the number by one half.
        Under Augustus it had risen to 200,000. This emperor desired to
        restrict the distribution of corn to three or four times a year, but,
        yielding to the popular wish, he at last consented that it should
        continue monthly. It soon became the leading fact of Roman life.
        Numerous officers were appointed to provide it. A severe legislation
        controlled their acts, and to secure a regular and abundant supply of
        corn for the capital became the principal object of the provincial
        governors. Under the Antonines the number of the recipients had
        considerably increased, having sometimes, it is said, exceeded
        500,000. Septimus Severus added to the corn a ration of oil. Aurelian
        replaced the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg
        075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        monthly distribution of unground corn by a daily distribution of
        bread, and added, moreover, a portion of pork. Gratuitous
        distributions were afterwards extended to Constantinople, Alexandria,
        and Antioch, and were probably not altogether unknown in smaller
        towns.<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href=
        "#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have already
        seen that this gratuitous distribution of corn ranked, with the
        institution of slavery and the gladiatorial exhibitions, as one of
        the chief demoralising influences of the Empire. The most injudicious
        charity, however pernicious to the classes it is intended to relieve,
        has commonly a beneficial and softening influence upon the donor, and
        through him upon society at large. But the Roman distribution of
        corn, being merely a political device, had no humanising influence
        upon the people, while, being regulated only by the indigence, and
        not at all by the infirmities or character, of the recipient, it was
        a direct and overwhelming encouragement to idleness. With a provision
        of the necessaries of life, and with an abundant supply of
        amusements, the poor Romans readily gave up honourable labour, all
        trades in the city languished, every interruption in the distribution
        of corn was followed by fearful sufferings, free gifts of land were
        often insufficient to attract the citizens to honest labour, and the
        multiplication of children, which rendered the public relief
        inadequate, was checked by abortion, exposition, or infanticide.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we remember
        that the population of Rome probably never exceeded a million and a
        half, that a large proportion of the indigent were provided for as
        slaves, and that more than 200,000 freemen were habitually supplied
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076"
        id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with the first necessary of
        life, we cannot, I think, charge the Pagan society of the metropolis,
        at least, with an excessive parsimony in relieving poverty. But
        besides the distribution of corn, several other measures were taken.
        Salt, which was very largely used by the Roman poor, had during the
        Republic been made a monopoly of the State, and was sold by it at a
        price that was little more than nominal.<a id="noteref_145" name=

        distribution of land, which was the subject of the agrarian laws,
        was, under a new form, practised by Julius Cæsar,<a id="noteref_146"
        name="noteref_146" href="#note_146"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        bought land to divide it among the poor citizens. Large legacies were
        left to the people by Julius Cæsar, Augustus, and others, and
        considerable, though irregular, donations made on occasions of great
        rejoicings. Numerous public baths were established, to which, when
        they were not absolutely gratuitous, the smallest coin in use gave
        admission, and which were in consequence habitually employed by the
        poor. Vespasian instituted, and the Antonines extended, a system of
        popular education, and the movement I have already noticed, for the
        support of the children of poor parents, acquired very considerable
        proportions. The first trace of it at Rome may be found under
        Augustus, who gave money and corn for the support of young children,
        who had previously not been included in the public
        distributions.<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href=

        appears, however, to have been but an act of isolated benevolence,
        and the honour of first instituting a systematic effort in this

        children, not only in Rome, but in all the cities of Italy.<a id=

        similar measures, though we know not on what scale, were taken in the
        other Italian and even African cities. At the little town of Velleia,
        we find a charity instituted by Trajan, for the partial support of
        270 children.<a id="noteref_152" name="noteref_152" href=

        benevolence followed in the same direction, and several inscriptions
        which still remain, though they do not enable us to write its

        warmly encouraging schools, devoted a small property to the support
        of poor children in his native city of Como.<a id="noteref_153" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These various
        measures are by no means inconsiderable, and it is not unreasonable
        to suppose that many similar steps were taken, of which all record
        has been lost. The history of charity presents so few salient
        features, so little that can strike the imagination or arrest the
        attention, that it is usually almost wholly neglected by historians;
        and it is easy to conceive what inadequate notions of our existing
        charities could be gleaned from the casual allusions in plays or
        poems, in political histories or court memoirs. There can, however,
        be no question that neither in practice nor in theory, neither in the
        institutions that were founded nor in the place that was assigned to
        it in the scale of duties, did charity in antiquity occupy a position
        at all comparable to that which it has obtained by Christianity.
        Nearly all relief was a State measure, dictated much more by policy
        than by benevolence; and the habit of selling young children, the
        innumerable expositions, the readiness of the poor to enrol
        themselves as gladiators, and the frequent famines, show how large
        was the measure of unrelieved distress. A very few Pagan examples of
        charity have, indeed, descended to us. Among the Greeks we find
        Epaminondas ransoming captives, and collecting dowers for poor
        girls;<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href=

        very frequent reference to mendicancy in the Latin writers shows that
        beggars, and therefore those who relieved beggars, were numerous. The
        duty of hospitality was also strongly enjoined, and was placed under
        the special protection of the supreme Deity. But the active,
        habitual, and detailed charity of private persons, which is so
        conspicuous a feature in all Christian societies, was scarcely known
        in antiquity, and there are not more than two or three moralists who
        have even noticed it. Of these, the chief rank belongs to Cicero, who
        devoted two very judicious but somewhat cold chapters to the subject.
        Nothing, he said, is more suitable to the nature of man than
        beneficence or liberality, but there are many cautions to be urged in
        practising it. We must take care that our bounty is a real blessing
        to the person we relieve; that it does not exceed our own means; that
        it is not, as was the case with Sylla and Cæsar, derived from the
        spoliation of others; that it springs from the heart and not from
        ostentation; that the claims of gratitude are preferred to the mere
        impulses of compassion, and that due regard is paid both to the
        character and to the wants of the recipient.<a id="noteref_167" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Christianity for
        the first time made charity a rudimentary virtue, giving it a leading
        place in the moral type, and in the exhortations of its teachers.
        Besides its general influence in stimulating the affections, it
        effected a complete revolution in this sphere, by regarding the poor
        as the special representatives of the Christian Founder, and thus
        making the love of Christ, rather than the love of man, the principle
        of charity. Even in the days of persecution, collections for the
        relief of the poor were made at the Sunday meetings. The agapæ or
        feasts of love were intended mainly for the poor, and food that was
        saved by the fasts was devoted to their benefit. A vast organisation
        of charity, presided over <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg
        080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by
        the bishops, and actively directed by the deacons, soon ramified over
        Christendom, till the bond of charity became the bond of unity, and
        the most distant sections of the Christian Church corresponded by the
        interchange of mercy. Long before the era of Constantine, it was
        observed that the charities of the Christians were so extensive—it
        may, perhaps, be said so excessive—that they drew very many impostors
        to the Church;<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href=
        "#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a> and
        when the victory of Christianity was achieved, the enthusiasm for
        charity displayed itself in the erection of numerous institutions
        that were altogether unknown to the Pagan world. A Roman lady, named
        Fabiola, in the fourth century, founded at Rome, as an act of
        penance, the first public hospital, and the charity planted by that
        woman's hand overspread the world, and will alleviate, to the end of
        time, the darkest anguish of humanity. Another hospital was soon
        after founded by St. Pammachus; another of great celebrity by St.
        Basil, at Cæsarea. St. Basil also erected at Cæsarea what was
        probably the first asylum for lepers. Xenodochia, or refuges for
        strangers, speedily rose, especially along the paths of the pilgrims.
        St. Pammachus founded one at Ostia; Paula and Melania founded others
        at Jerusalem. The Council of Nice ordered that one should be erected
        in every city. In the time of St. Chrysostom the church of Antioch
        supported 3,000 widows and virgins, besides strangers and sick.
        Legacies for the poor became common; and it was not unfrequent for
        men and women who desired to live a life of peculiar sanctity, and
        especially for priests who attained the episcopacy <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to bestow their entire properties in
        charity. Even the early Oriental monks, who for the most part were
        extremely removed from the active and social virtues, supplied many
        noble examples of charity. St. Ephrem, in a time of pestilence,
        emerged from his solitude to found and superintend a hospital at
        Edessa. A monk named Thalasius collected blind beggars in an asylum
        on the banks of the Euphrates. A merchant named Apollonius founded on
        Mount Nitria a gratuitous dispensary for the monks. The monks often
        assisted by their labours provinces that were suffering from
        pestilence or famine. We may trace the remains of the pure socialism
        that marked the first phase of the Christian community, in the
        emphatic language with which some of the Fathers proclaimed charity
        to be a matter not of mercy but of justice, maintaining that all
        property is based on usurpation, that the earth by right is common to
        all men, and that no man can claim a superabundant supply of its
        goods except as an administrator for others. A Christian, it was
        maintained, should devote at least one-tenth of his profits to the
        poor.<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href=
        "#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The enthusiasm of
        charity, thus manifested in the Church, speedily attracted the
        attention of the Pagans. The ridicule of Lucian, and the vain efforts
        of Julian to produce a rival system of charity within the limits of
        Paganism,<a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href=
        "#note_170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        emphatically attested both its pre-eminence and its catholicity.
        During <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name=

        desolated Carthage in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 326, and Alexandria in
        the reigns of Gallienus and of Maximian, while the Pagans fled
        panic-stricken from the contagion, the Christians extorted the
        admiration of their fellow-countrymen by the courage with which they
        rallied around their bishops, consoled the last hours of the
        sufferers, and buried the abandoned dead.<a id="noteref_171" name=
        "noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class=

        rapid increase of pauperism arising from the emancipation of numerous
        slaves, their charity found free scope for action, and its resources
        were soon taxed to the utmost by the horrors of the barbarian
        invasions. The conquest of Africa by Genseric deprived Italy of the
        supply of corn upon which it almost wholly depended, arrested the
        gratuitous distribution by which the Roman poor were mainly
        supported, and produced all over the land the most appalling
        calamities.<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href=
        "#note_172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a> The
        history of Italy became one monotonous tale of famine and pestilence,
        of starving populations and ruined cities. But everywhere amid this
        chaos of dissolution we may detect the majestic form of the Christian
        priest mediating between the hostile forces, straining every nerve to
        lighten the calamities around him. When the Imperial city was
        captured and plundered by the hosts of Alaric, a Christian church
        remained a secure sanctuary, which neither the passions nor the
        avarice of the Goths transgressed. When a fiercer than Alaric had
        marked out Rome for his prey, the Pope St. Leo, arrayed in his
        sacerdotal robes, confronted the victorious Hun, as the ambassador
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083"
        id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of his fellow-countrymen, and
        Attila, overpowered by religious awe, turned aside in his course.
        When, two years later, Rome lay at the mercy of Genseric, the same
        Pope interposed with the Vandal conqueror, and obtained from him a
        partial cessation of the massacre. The Archdeacon Pelagius interceded
        with similar humanity and similar success, when Rome had been
        captured by Totila. In Gaul, Troyes is said to have been saved from
        destruction by the influence of St. Lupus, and Orleans by the
        influence of St. Agnan. In Britain an invasion of the Picts was
        averted by St. Germain of Auxerre. The relations of rulers to their
        subjects, and of tribunals to the poor, were modified by the same
        intervention. When Antioch was threatened with destruction on account
        of its rebellion against Theodosius, the anchorites poured forth from
        the neighbouring deserts to intercede with the ministers of the
        emperor, while the Archbishop Flavian went himself as a suppliant to
        Constantinople. St. Ambrose imposed public penance on Theodosius, on
        account of the massacre of Thessalonica. Synesius excommunicated for
        his oppressions a governor named Andronicus; and two French Councils,
        in the sixth century, imposed the same penalty on all great men who
        arbitrarily ejected the poor. Special laws were found necessary to
        restrain the turbulent charity of some priests and monks, who impeded
        the course of justice, and even snatched criminals from the hands of
        the law.<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href=

        Abraham, St. Epiphanius, and St. Basil are all said to have obtained
        the remission or reduction of oppressive imposts. To provide for the
        interests of widows and orphans was part of the official
        ecclesiastical duty, and a Council of Macon anathematised any ruler
        who brought them to trial without first apprising the bishop of the
        diocese. A Council of Toledo, in the fifth century, threatened with
        excommunication all who robbed priests, monks, or poor <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> men, or refused to listen to their
        expostulations. One of the chief causes of the inordinate power
        acquired by the clergy was their mediatorial office, and their
        gigantic wealth was in a great degree due to the legacies of those
        who regarded them as the trustees of the poor. As time rolled on,
        charity assumed many forms, and every monastery became a centre from
        which it radiated. By the monks the nobles were overawed, the poor
        protected, the sick tended, travellers sheltered, prisoners ransomed,
        the remotest spheres of suffering explored. During the darkest period
        of the middle ages, monks founded a refuge for pilgrims amid the
        horrors of the Alpine snows. A solitary hermit often planted himself,
        with his little boat, by a bridgeless stream, and the charity of his
        life was to ferry over the traveller.<a id="noteref_174" name=
        "noteref_174" href="#note_174"><span class=

        the hideous disease of leprosy extended its ravages over Europe, when
        the minds of men were filled with terror, not only by its
        loathsomeness and its contagion, but also by the notion that it was
        in a peculiar sense supernatural,<a id="noteref_175" name=
        "noteref_175" href="#note_175"><span class=

        Sometimes, the legends say, the leper's form was in a moment
        transfigured, and he who came to tend the most loathsome of mankind
        received his reward, for he found himself in the presence of his
        Lord.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no fact
        of which an historian becomes more <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> speedily or more painfully conscious than the
        great difference between the importance and the dramatic interest of
        the subjects he treats. Wars or massacres, the horrors of martyrdom
        or the splendours of individual prowess, are susceptible of such
        brilliant colouring, that with but little literary skill they can be
        so pourtrayed that their importance is adequately realised, and they
        appeal powerfully to the emotions of the reader. But this vast and
        unostentatious movement of charity, operating in the village hamlet
        and in the lonely hospital, staunching the widow's tears, and
        following all the windings of the poor man's griefs, presents few
        features the imagination can grasp, and leaves no deep impression
        upon the mind. The greatest things are often those which are most
        imperfectly realised; and surely no achievements of the Christian
        Church are more truly great than those which it has effected in the
        sphere of charity. For the first time in the history of mankind, it
        has inspired many thousands of men and women, at the sacrifice of all
        worldly interests, and often under circumstances of extreme
        discomfort or danger, to devote their entire lives to the single
        object of assuaging the sufferings of humanity. It has covered the
        globe with countless institutions of mercy, absolutely unknown to the
        whole Pagan world. It has indissolubly united, in the minds of men,
        the idea of supreme goodness with that of active and constant
        benevolence. It has placed in every parish a religious minister, who,
        whatever may be his other functions, has at least been officially
        charged with the superintendence of an organisation of charity, and
        who finds in this office one of the most important as well as one of
        the most legitimate sources of his power.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are,
        however, two important qualifications to the admiration with which we
        regard the history of Christian charity—one relating to a particular
        form of suffering, and the other of a more general kind. A strong,
        ill-defined notion of the supernatural character of insanity had
        existed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name=
        "Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> from the earliest
        times; but there were special circumstances which rendered the action
        of the Church peculiarly unfavourable to those who were either
        predisposed to or afflicted with this calamity. The reality both of
        witchcraft and diabolical possession had been distinctly recognised
        in the Jewish writings. The received opinions about eternal torture,
        and ever-present dæmons, and the continued strain upon the
        imagination, in dwelling upon an unseen world, were pre-eminently
        fitted to produce madness in those who were at all predisposed to it,
        and, where insanity had actually appeared, to determine the form and
        complexion of the hallucinations of the maniac.<a id="noteref_177"
        name="noteref_177" href="#note_177"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a>
        Theology supplying all the images that acted most powerfully upon the
        imagination, most madness, for many centuries, took a theological
        cast. One important department of it appears chiefly in the lives of
        the saints. Men of lively imaginations and absolute ignorance, living
        apart from all their fellows, amid the horrors of a savage
        wilderness, practising austerities by which their physical system was
        thoroughly deranged, and firmly persuaded that innumerable devils
        were continually hovering about their cells and interfering with
        their devotions, speedily and very naturally became subject to
        constant hallucinations, which probably form the nucleus of truth in
        the legends of their lives. But it was impossible that insanity
        should confine itself to the orthodox forms of celestial visions, or
        of the apparitions and the defeats of devils. Very frequently it led
        the unhappy maniac to some delusion, which called down <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> upon him the speedy sentence of the
        Church. Thus, in the year 1300, the corpse of a Bohemian or,
        according to another version, an English girl who imagined herself to
        be the Holy Ghost incarnate for the redemption of women, was dug up
        and burnt, and two women who believed in her perished at the
        stake.<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href=
        "#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a> In the
        year 1359, a Spaniard declared himself to be the brother of the
        archangel Michael, and to be destined for the place in heaven which
        Satan had lost; and he added that he was accustomed every day both to
        mount into heaven and descend into hell, that the end of the world
        was at hand, and that it was reserved for him to enter into single
        combat with Antichrist. The poor lunatic fell into the hands of the
        Archbishop of Toledo, and was burnt alive.<a id="noteref_179" name=
        "noteref_179" href="#note_179"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a> In some
        cases the hallucination took the form of an irregular inspiration. On
        this charge, Joan of Arc, and another girl who had been fired by her
        example, and had endeavoured, apparently under a genuine
        hallucination, to follow her career,<a id="noteref_180" name=
        "noteref_180" href="#note_180"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a> were
        burnt alive. A famous Spanish physician and scholar, named Torralba,
        who lived in the sixteenth century, and who imagined that he had an
        attendant angel continually about him, escaped with public penance
        and confession;<a id="noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href=
        "#note_181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088"
        id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> professor of theology in Lima,
        who laboured under the same delusion, and added to it some wild
        notions about his spiritual dignities, was less fortunate. He was
        burnt by the Inquisition of Peru.<a id="noteref_182" name=
        "noteref_182" href="#note_182"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">182</span></span></a> Most
        commonly, however, the theological notions about witchcraft either
        produced madness or determined its form, and, through the influence
        of the clergy of the different sections of the Christian Church, many
        thousands of unhappy women, who, from their age, their loneliness,
        and their infirmity, were most deserving of pity, were devoted to the
        hatred of mankind, and, having been tortured with horrible and
        ingenious cruelty, were at last burnt alive.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The existence,
        however, of some forms of natural madness was generally admitted; but
        the measures for the relief of the unhappy victims were very few, and
        very ill judged. Among the ancients, they were brought to the
        temples, and subjected to imposing ceremonies, which were believed
        supernaturally to relieve them, and which probably had a favourable
        influence through their action upon the imagination. The great Greek
        physicians had devoted considerable attention to this malady, and
        some of their precepts anticipated modern discoveries; but no lunatic
        asylum appears to have existed in antiquity.<a id="noteref_183" name=
        "noteref_183" href="#note_183"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a> In the
        first period of the hermit life, when many anchorites became insane
        through their penances, a refuge is said to have been opened for them
        at Jerusalem.<a id="noteref_184" name="noteref_184" href=
        "#note_184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        appears, however, to be a solitary instance, arising from the
        exigencies of a single class, and no lunatic asylum existed in
        Christian Europe till the fifteenth century. The Mohammedans, in this
        form of charity, seem to have preceded the Christians. Benjamin of
        Tudela, who visited Bagdad in the twelfth century, describes a palace
        in that city, called <span class="tei tei-q">“the House of
        Mercy,”</span> in which all mad persons found in the country were
        confined and bound with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg
        089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        iron chains. They were carefully examined every month and released as
        soon as they recovered.<a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185" href=

        Africanus notices the existence of a similar institution at Fez, in

        is probable that the care of the insane was a general form of charity
        in Mohammedan countries. Among the Christians it first appeared in
        quarters contiguous to the Mohammedans; but there is, I think, no
        real evidence that it was derived from Mohammedan example. The
        Knights of Malta were famous as the one order who admitted lunatics
        into their hospitals; but no Christian asylum expressly for their
        benefit existed till 1409. The honour of instituting this form of
        charity in Christendom belongs to Spain. A monk named Juan Gilaberto
        Joffre, filled with compassion at the sight of the maniacs who were
        hooted by crowds through the streets of Valencia, founded an asylum
        in that city, and his example was speedily followed in other
        provinces. The new charity was introduced into Saragossa in
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1425, into Seville and
        Valladolid in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1436, into Toledo in
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1483. All these
        institutions existed before a single lunatic asylum had been founded
        in any other part of Christendom.<a id="noteref_188" name=
        "noteref_188" href="#note_188"><span class=

        other very honourable facts may be mentioned, establishing the
        preeminence of Spanish charity in this field. The first is, that the
        oldest lunatic asylum in the metropolis of Catholicism was that
        erected by Spaniards, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1548.<a id=

        second is, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg
        090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        that when, at the close of the last century, Pinel began his great
        labours in this sphere, he pronounced Spain to be the country in
        which lunatics were treated with most wisdom and most humanity.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In most countries
        their condition was indeed truly deplorable. While many thousands
        were burnt as witches, those who were recognised as insane were
        compelled to endure all the horrors of the harshest imprisonment.
        Blows, bleeding, and chains were their usual treatment, and horrible
        accounts were given of madmen who had spent decades bound in dark
        cells.<a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href=
        "#note_191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a> Such
        treatment naturally aggravated their malady, and that malady in many
        cases rendered impossible the resignation and ultimate torpor which
        alleviate the sufferings of ordinary prisoners. Not until the
        eighteenth century was the condition of this unhappy class seriously
        improved. The combined progress of theological scepticism and
        scientific knowledge relegated witchcraft to the world of phantoms,
        and the exertions of Morgagni in Italy, of Cullen in Scotland, and of
        Pinel in France, renovated the whole treatment of acknowledged
        lunatics.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
        qualification to the admiration with which we regard the history of
        Christian charity arises from the undoubted fact that a large
        proportion of charitable institutions have directly increased the
        poverty they were intended to relieve. The question of the utility
        and nature of charity is one which, since the modern discoveries of
        political economy, has elicited much discussion, and in many cases, I
        think, much exaggeration. What political economy has effected on the
        subject may be comprised under two heads. It has elucidated more
        clearly, and in greater detail than had before been done, the effect
        of provident self-interest in determining the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> welfare of societies, and it has
        established a broad distinction between productive and unproductive
        expenditure. It has shown that, where idleness is supported, idleness
        will become common; that, where systematic public provision is made
        for old age, the parsimony of foresight will be neglected; and that
        therefore these forms of charity, by encouraging habits of idleness
        and improvidence, ultimately increase the wretchedness they were
        intended to alleviate. It has also shown that, while unproductive
        expenditure, such as that which is devoted to amusements or luxury,
        is undoubtedly beneficial to those who provide it, the fruit perishes
        in the usage; while productive expenditure, such as the manufacture
        of machines, or the improvement of the soil, or the extension of
        commercial enterprise, gives a new impulse to the creation of wealth.
        It has proved that the first condition of the rapid accumulation of
        capital is the diversion of money from unproductive to productive
        channels, and that the amount of accumulated capital is one of the
        two regulating influences of the wages of the labourer. From these
        positions some persons have inferred that charity should be condemned
        as a form of unproductive expenditure. But, in the first place, all
        charities that foster habits of forethought and develop new
        capacities in the poorer classes, such as popular education, or the
        formation of savings banks, or insurance companies, or, in many
        cases, small and discriminating loans, or measures directed to the
        suppression of dissipation, are in the strictest sense productive;
        and the same may be said of many forms of employment, given in
        exceptional crises through charitable motives; and, in the next
        place, it is only necessary to remember that the happiness of
        mankind, to which the accumulation of wealth should only be regarded
        as a means, is the real object of charity, and it will appear that
        many forms which are not strictly productive, in the commercial
        sense, are in the highest degree conducive to this end, and have no
        serious counteracting evil. In the alleviation of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> those sufferings that do not spring
        either from improvidence or from vice, the warmest as well as the
        most enlightened charity will find an ample sphere for its
        exertions.<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href=
        "#note_192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192</span></span></a>
        Blindness, and other exceptional calamities, against the effects of
        which prudence does not and cannot provide, the miseries resulting
        from epidemics, from war, from famine, from the first sudden collapse
        of industry, produced by new inventions or changes in the channels of
        commerce; hospitals, which, besides other advantages, are the
        greatest schools of medical science, and withdraw from the crowded
        alley multitudes who would otherwise form centres of contagion—these,
        and such as these, will long tax to the utmost the generosity of the
        wealthy; while, even in the spheres upon which the political
        economist looks with the most unfavourable eye, exceptional cases
        will justify exceptional assistance. The charity which is pernicious
        is commonly not the highest but the lowest kind. The rich man,
        prodigal of money, which is to him of little value, but altogether
        incapable of devoting any personal attention to the object of his
        alms, often injures society by his donations; but this is rarely the
        case with that far nobler charity which makes men familiar with the
        haunts of wretchedness, and follows the object of its care through
        all the phases of his life. The question of the utility of charity is
        merely a question of ultimate consequences. Political economy has, no
        doubt, laid down some general rules of great value on the subject;
        but yet the pages which Cicero devoted to it nearly two thousand
        years ago might have been written by the most enlightened modern
        economist; and it will be continually found that the Protestant lady,
        working in her parish, by the simple force of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> common sense and by a scrupulous and
        minute attention to the condition and character of those whom she
        relieves, is unconsciously illustrating with perfect accuracy the
        enlightened charity of Malthus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in order that
        charity should be useful, it is essential that the benefit of the
        sufferer should be a real object to the donor; and a very large
        proportion of the evils that have arisen from Catholic charity may be
        traced to the absence of this condition. The first substitution of
        devotion for philanthropy, as the motive of benevolence, gave so
        powerful a stimulus to the affections, that it may on the whole be
        regarded as a benefit, though, by making compassion operate solely
        through a theological medium, it often produced among theologians a
        more than common indifference to the sufferings of all who were
        external to their religious community. But the new principle speedily
        degenerated into a belief in the expiatory nature of the gifts. A
        form of what may be termed selfish charity arose, which acquired at
        last gigantic proportions, and exercised a most pernicious influence
        upon Christendom. Men gave money to the poor, simply and exclusively
        for their own spiritual benefit, and the welfare of the sufferer was
        altogether foreign to their thoughts.<a id="noteref_193" name=
        "noteref_193" href="#note_193"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The evil which
        thus arose from some forms of Catholic charity may be traced from a
        very early period, but it only acquired its full magnitude after some
        centuries. The Roman system of gratuitous distribution was, in the
        eyes of the political economist, about the worst that could be
        conceived, and the charity of the Church being, in at least a
        measure, discriminating, was at first a very great, though even then
        not an unmingled, good. Labour was also not unfrequently enjoined
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094"
        id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as a duty by the Fathers, and
        at a later period the services of the Benedictine monks, in
        destroying by their example the stigma which slavery had attached to
        it, were very great. Still, one of the first consequences of the
        exuberant charity of the Church was to multiply impostors and
        mendicants, and the idleness of the monks was one of the earliest
        complaints. Valentinian made a severe law, condemning robust beggars
        to perpetual slavery. As the monastic system was increased, and
        especially after the mendicant orders had consecrated mendicancy, the
        evil assumed gigantic dimensions. Many thousands of strong men,
        absolutely without private means, were in every country withdrawn
        from productive labour, and supported by charity. The notion of the
        meritorious nature of simple almsgiving immeasurably multiplied
        beggars. The stigma, which it is the highest interest of society to
        attach to mendicancy, it became a main object of theologians to
        remove. Saints wandered through the world begging money, that they
        might give to beggars, or depriving themselves of their garments,
        that they might clothe the naked, and the result of their teaching
        was speedily apparent. In all Catholic countries where ecclesiastical
        influences have been permitted to develop unmolested, the monastic
        organisations have proved a deadly canker, corroding the prosperity
        of the nation. Withdrawing multitudes from all production,
        encouraging a blind and pernicious almsgiving, diffusing habits of
        improvidence through the poorer classes, fostering an ignorant
        admiration for saintly poverty, and an equally ignorant antipathy to
        the habits and aims of an industrial civilisation, they have
        paralysed all energy, and proved an insuperable barrier to material
        progress. The poverty they have relieved has been insignificant
        compared with the poverty they have caused. In no case was the
        abolition of monasteries effected in a more indefensible manner than
        in England; but the transfer of property, that was once employed in a
        great measure in charity, to the courtiers of King Henry, was
        ultimately <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg
        095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a
        benefit to the English poor; for no misapplication of this property
        by private persons could produce as much evil as an unrestrained
        monasticism. The value of Catholic services in alleviating pain and
        sickness, and the more exceptional forms of suffering, can never be
        overrated. The noble heroism of her servants, who have devoted
        themselves to charity, has never been surpassed, and the perfection
        of their organisation has, I think, never been equalled; but in the
        sphere of simple poverty it can hardly be doubted that the Catholic
        Church has created more misery than it has cured.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still, even in
        this field, we must not forget the benefits resulting, if not to the
        sufferer, at least to the donor. Charitable habits, even when formed
        in the first instance from selfish motives, even when so misdirected
        as to be positively injurious to the recipient, rarely fail to
        exercise a softening and purifying influence on the character. All
        through the darkest period of the middle ages, amid ferocity and
        fanaticism and brutality, we may trace the subduing influence of
        Catholic charity, blending strangely with every excess of violence
        and every outburst of persecution. It would be difficult to conceive
        a more frightful picture of society than is presented by the history
        of Gregory of Tours; but that long series of atrocious crimes,
        narrated with an almost appalling tranquillity, is continually
        interspersed with accounts of kings, queens, or prelates, who, in the
        midst of the disorganised society, made the relief of the poor the
        main object of their lives. No period of history exhibits a larger
        amount of cruelty, licentiousness, and fanaticism than the Crusades;
        but side by side with the military enthusiasm, and with the almost
        universal corruption, there expanded a vast movement of charity,
        which covered Christendom with hospitals for the relief of leprosy,
        and which grappled nobly, though ineffectually, with the many forms
        of suffering that were generated. St. Peter Nolasco, whose great
        labours in ransoming captive Christians I have already noticed, was
        an active participator <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg
        096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in
        the atrocious massacre of the Albigenses.<a id="noteref_194" name=

        Shane O'Neale, one of the ablest, but also one of the most ferocious,
        Irish chieftains who ever defied the English power, it is related,
        amid a crowd of crimes, that, <span class="tei tei-q">“sitting at
        meat, before he put one morsel into his mouth he used to slice a
        portion above the daily alms, and send it to some beggar at his gate,
        saying it was meet to serve Christ first.”</span><a id="noteref_195"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great evils
        produced by the encouragement of mendicancy which has always
        accompanied the uncontrolled development of Catholicity, have
        naturally given rise to much discussion and legislation. The fierce
        denunciations of the mendicant orders by William of St. Amour in the
        thirteenth century were not on account of their encouragement of
        mischievous charity;<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href=
        "#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        of the disciples of Wycliffe, named Nicholas of Hereford, was
        conspicuous for his opposition to indiscriminate gifts to
        beggars;<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href=
        "#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a> and a
        few measures of an extended order appear to have been taken even
        before the Reformation.<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href=
        "#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a> In
        England laws of the most savage cruelty were then passed, in hopes of
        eradicating mendicancy. A parliament of Henry VIII., before the
        suppression of the monasteries, issued a law providing a system of
        organised charity, and imposing on any one who gave anything to a
        beggar a fine of ten times the value of his gift. A sturdy beggar was
        to be punished with whipping for the first offence, with whipping and
        the loss of the tip of his ear for the second <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and with death for the third.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a> Under
        Edward VI., an atrocious law, which, however, was repealed in the
        same reign, enacted that every sturdy beggar who refused to work
        should be branded, and adjudged for two years as a slave to the
        person who gave information against him; and if he took flight during
        his period of servitude, he was condemned for the first offence to
        perpetual slavery, and for the second to death. The master was
        authorised to put a ring of iron round the neck of his slave, to
        chain him, and to scourge him. Any one might take the children of a
        sturdy beggar for apprentices, till the boys were twenty-four and the
        girls twenty.<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href=
        "#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> Another
        law, made under Elizabeth, punished with death any strong man under
        the age of eighteen who was convicted for the third time of begging;
        but the penalty in this reign was afterwards reduced to a life-long
        service in the galleys, or to banishment, with a penalty of death to
        the returned convict.<a id="noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href=

        the same queen the poor-law system was elaborated, and Malthus long
        afterwards showed that its effects in discouraging parsimony rendered
        it scarcely less pernicious than the monastic system that had
        preceded it. In many Catholic countries, severe, though less
        atrocious, measures were taken to grapple with the evil of
        mendicancy. That shrewd and sagacious pontiff, Sixtus V., who, though
        not the greatest man, was by far the greatest statesman who has ever
        sat on the papal throne, made praiseworthy efforts to check it at
        Rome, where ecclesiastical influence had always made it peculiarly
        prevalent.<a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href=

        glanced at the subject; and in 1704 Defoe published a very remarkable
        tract, called, <span class="tei tei-q">“Giving Alms no
        Charity,”</span> in which he noticed the extent to which mendicancy
        existed in England, though wages were higher than in any Continental

        pointed out with much force the gigantic development of mendicancy in
        Italy, traced it to the excessive charity of the people, and appears
        to have regarded as an evil all charity which sprang from religious
        motives and was greater than would spring from the unaided instincts

        the subject; but, with the qualifications I have stated, no new
        discoveries have, I conceive, thrown any just cloud upon the
        essential principle of Christian charity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last method by
        which Christianity has laboured to soften the characters of men has
        been by accustoming the imagination to expatiate continually upon
        images of tenderness and of pathos. Our imaginations, though less
        influential than our occupations, probably affect our moral
        characters more deeply than our judgments, and, in the case of the
        poorer classes especially, the cultivation of this part of our nature
        is of inestimable importance. Rooted, for the most part, during their
        entire lives, to a single spot, excluded by their ignorance and their
        circumstances from most of the varieties of interest that animate the
        minds of other men, condemned to constant and plodding labour, and
        engrossed for ever with the minute cares of an immediate and an
        anxious present, their whole natures would have been hopelessly
        contracted, were there no sphere in which their imaginations could
        expand. Religion is the one romance of the poor. It alone extends the
        narrow horizon of their thoughts, supplies the images of their
        dreams, allures them to the supersensual and the ideal. The graceful
        beings with which the creative fancy of Paganism peopled the universe
        shed a poetic glow on the peasant's toil. Every stage of agriculture
        was presided over by a divinity, and the world grew bright by the
        companionship of the gods. But it is the peculiarity of the Christian
        types, that, while they have fascinated the imagination, they have
        also purified the heart. The tender, winning, and almost feminine
        beauty of the Christian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg
        100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Founder, the Virgin mother, the agonies of Gethsemane or of Calvary,
        the many scenes of compassion and suffering that fill the sacred
        writings, are the pictures which, for eighteen hundred years, have
        governed the imaginations of the rudest and most ignorant of mankind.
        Associated with the fondest recollections of childhood, with the
        music of the church bells, with the clustered lights and the tinsel
        splendour, that seem to the peasant the very ideal of majesty;
        painted over the altar where he received the companion of his life,
        around the cemetery where so many whom he had loved were laid, on the
        stations of the mountain, on the portal of the vineyard, on the
        chapel where the storm-tossed mariner fulfils his grateful vow;
        keeping guard over his cottage door, and looking down upon his humble
        bed, forms of tender beauty and gentle pathos for ever haunt the poor
        man's fancy, and silently win their way into the very depths of his
        being. More than any spoken eloquence, more than any dogmatic
        teaching, they transform and subdue his character, till he learns to
        realise the sanctity of weakness and suffering, the supreme majesty
        of compassion and gentleness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Imperfect and
        inadequate as is the sketch I have drawn, it will be sufficient to
        show how great and multiform have been the influences of Christian
        philanthropy. The shadows that rest upon the picture, I have not
        concealed; but, when all due allowance has been made for them, enough
        will remain to claim our deepest admiration. The high conception that
        has been formed of the sanctity of human life, the protection of
        infancy, the elevation and final emancipation of the slave classes,
        the suppression of barbarous games, the creation of a vast and
        multifarious organisation of charity, and the education of the
        imagination by the Christian type, constitute together a movement of
        philanthropy which has never been paralleled or approached in the
        Pagan world. The effects of this movement in promoting happiness have
        been very great. Its effect in determining character has probably
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101"
        id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> been still greater. In that
        proportion or disposition of qualities which constitutes the ideal
        character, the gentler and more benevolent virtues have obtained,
        through Christianity, the foremost place. In the first and purest
        period they were especially supreme; but in the third century a great
        ascetic movement arose, which gradually brought a new type of
        character into the ascendant, and diverted the enthusiasm of the
        Church into new channels.</p>

        writing in the second century, contrasts, in a well-known passage,
        the Christians of his day with the gymnosophists or hermits of India,
        declaring that, unlike these, the Christians did not fly from the
        world, but mixed with Pagans in the forum, in the market-places, in
        the public baths, in the ordinary business of life.<a id=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a> But
        although the life of the hermit or the monk was unknown in the Church
        for more than two hundred years after its foundation, we may detect,
        almost from the earliest time, a tone of feeling which produces it.
        The central conceptions of the monastic system are the
        meritoriousness of complete abstinence from all sexual intercourse,
        and of complete renunciation of the world. The first of these notions
        appeared in the very earliest period, in the respect attached to the
        condition of virginity, which was always regarded as sacred, and
        especially esteemed in the clergy, though for a long time it was not
        imposed as an obligation. The second was shown in the numerous
        efforts that were made to separate the Christian community as far as
        possible from the society in which it existed. Nothing could be more
        natural than that, when the increase and triumph of the Church had
        thrown the bulk of the Christians into active political or military
        labour, some should, as an exercise of piety, have endeavoured to
        imitate the separation from the world which was once <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the common condition of all. Besides
        this, a movement of asceticism had long been raging like a mental
        epidemic through the world. Among the Jews—whose law, from the great
        stress it laid upon marriage, the excellence of the rapid
        multiplication of population, and the hope of being the ancestor of
        the Messiah, was peculiarly repugnant to monastic conceptions—the
        Essenes had constituted a complete monastic society, abstaining from
        marriage and separating themselves wholly from the world. In Rome,
        whose practical genius was, if possible, even more opposed than that
        of the Jews to an inactive monasticism, and even among those
        philosophers who most represented its active and practical spirit,
        the same tendency was shown. The Cynics of the later Empire
        recommended a complete renunciation of domestic ties, and a life
        spent mainly in the contemplation of wisdom. The Egyptian philosophy,
        that soon after acquired an ascendancy in Europe, anticipated still
        more closely the monastic ideal. On the outskirts of the Church, the
        many sects of Gnostics and Manicheans all held under different forms
        the essential evil of matter. The Docetæ, following the same notion,
        denied the reality of the body of Christ. The Montanists and the
        Novatians surpassed and stimulated the private penances of the
        orthodox.<a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href=
        "#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a> The
        soil was thus thoroughly prepared for a great outburst of asceticism,
        whenever the first seed was sown. This was done during the Decian
        persecution. Paul, the hermit, who fled to the desert during that
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103"
        id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> persecution, is said to have
        been the first of the tribe.<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212"
        href="#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a> Antony,
        who speedily followed, greatly extended the movement, and in a few
        years the hermits had become a mighty nation. Persecution, which in
        the first instance drove great numbers as fugitives to the deserts,
        soon aroused a passionate religious enthusiasm that showed itself in
        an ardent desire for those sufferings which were believed to lead
        directly to heaven; and this enthusiasm, after the peace of
        Constantine, found its natural vent and sphere in the macerations of
        the desert life. The imaginations of men were fascinated by the
        poetic circumstances of that life which St. Jerome most eloquently
        embellished. Women were pre-eminent in recruiting for it. The same
        spirit that had formerly led the wife of the Pagan official to
        entertain secret relations with the Christian priests, now led the
        wife of the Christian to become the active agent of the monks. While
        the father designed his son for the army, or for some civil post, the
        mother was often straining every nerve to induce him to become a
        hermit. The monks secretly corresponded with her, they skilfully
        assumed the functions of education, in order that they might
        influence the young; and sometimes, to evade the precautions or the
        anger of the father, they concealed their profession, and assumed the
        garb of lay pedagogues.<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href=
        "#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        pulpit, which had almost superseded, and immeasurably transcended in
        influence, the chairs of the rhetoricians, and which was filled by
        such men as Ambrose, Augustine, Chrysostom, Basil, and the Gregories,
        was continually exerted in the same cause, and the extreme luxury of
        the great cities produced a violent, but not unnatural, reaction of
        asceticism. The dignity of the monastic position, which sometimes
        brought men who had been simple <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> peasants into connection with the emperors, the
        security it furnished to fugitive slaves and criminals, the desire of
        escaping from those fiscal burdens which, in the corrupt and
        oppressive administration of the Empire, had acquired an intolerable
        weight, and especially the barbarian invasions, which produced every
        variety of panic and wretchedness, conspired with the new religious
        teaching in peopling the desert. A theology of asceticism was
        speedily formed. The examples of Elijah and Elisha, to the first of
        whom, by a bold flight of imagination, some later Carmelites ascribed
        the origin of their order, and the more recent instance of the
        Baptist, were at once adduced. To an ordinary layman the life of an
        anchorite might appear in the highest degree opposed to that of the
        Teacher who began His mission at a marriage feast; who was
        continually reproached by His enemies for the readiness with which He
        mixed with the world, and who selected from the female sex some of
        His purest and most devoted followers; but the monkish theologians,
        avoiding, for the most part, these topics, dilated chiefly on His
        immaculate birth, His virgin mother, His life of celibacy, His
        exhortation to the rich young man. The fact that St. Peter, to whom a
        general primacy was already ascribed, was unquestionably married was
        a difficulty which was in a measure met by a tradition that both he,
        and the other married apostles, abstained from intercourse with their
        wives after their conversion.<a id="noteref_214" name="noteref_214"
        href="#note_214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">214</span></span></a> St.
        Paul, however, was probably unmarried, and his writings showed a
        decided preference for the unmarried state, which the ingenuity of
        theologians also discovered in some quarters where it might be least
        expected. Thus, St. Jerome assures us that when the clean animals
        entered the ark by sevens, and the unclean ones by pairs, the odd
        number typified the celibate, and the even the married condition.
        Even of the unclean animals but one pair of each <span class=

        Ecclesiastical tradition sustained the tendency, and Saint James, as
        he has been portrayed by Hegesippus, became a kind of ideal saint, a
        faithful picture of what, according to the notions of theologians,
        was the true type of human nobility. He <span class="tei tei-q">“was
        consecrated,”</span> it was said, <span class="tei tei-q">“from his
        mother's womb. He drank neither wine nor fermented liquors, and
        abstained from animal food. A razor never came upon his head. He
        never anointed himself with oil, or used a bath. He alone was allowed
        to enter the sanctuary. He never wore woollen, but linen, garments.
        He was in the habit of entering the temple alone, and was often found
        upon his bended knees, and interceding for the forgiveness of the
        people, so that his knees became as hard as a camel's.”</span><a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The progress of

        hesitate to speak with confidence. It is said that St. Pachomius,

        that, towards the close of the fourth century, the monastic

        was the parent of monachism, and it was there that it attained both
        its extreme development and its most austere severity; but there was
        very soon scarcely any Christian country in which a similar movement
        was not ardently propagated. St. Athanasius and St. Zeno are said to
        have introduced it into Italy,<a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224"
        href="#note_224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a> where
        it soon afterwards received a great stimulus from St. Jerome. St.
        Hilarion instituted the first monks in Palestine, and he lived to see
        many thousands subject to his rule, and towards the close of his life
        to plant monachism in Cyprus. Eustathius, Bishop of Sebastia, spread
        it through Armenia, Paphlagonia, and Pontus. St. Basil laboured along
        the wild shores of the Euxine. St. Martin of Tours founded the first
        monastery in Gaul, and 2,000 monks attended his funeral. Unrecorded
        missionaries planted the new institution in the heart of Æthiopia,
        amid the little islands that stud the Mediterranean, in the secluded
        valleys of Wales and Ireland.<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225"

        even more wonderful than the many thousands who thus abandoned the
        world is the reverence with which they were regarded by those who, by
        their attainments or their character, would seem most opposed to the
        monastic ideal. No one had more reason than Augustine to know the
        danger of enforced celibacy, but St. Augustine exerted all his
        energies to spread monasticism through his diocese. St. Ambrose, who
        was by nature an acute statesman; St. Jerome and St. Basil, who were
        ambitious scholars; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg
        107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> St.
        Chrysostom, who was pre-eminently formed to sway the refined throngs
        of a metropolis—all exerted their powers in favour of the life of
        solitude, and the last three practised it themselves. St. Arsenius,
        who was surpassed by no one in the extravagance of his penances, had
        held a high office at the court of the Emperor Arcadius. Pilgrims
        wandered among the deserts, collecting accounts of the miracles and
        the austerities of the saints, which filled Christendom with
        admiration; and the strange biographies which were thus formed, wild
        and grotesque as they are, enable us to realise very vividly the
        general features of the anchorite life which became the new ideal of
        the Christian world.<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href=

        no phase in the moral history of mankind of a deeper or more painful

        affection, passing his life in a long routine of useless and
        atrocious self-torture, and quailing before the ghastly phantoms of
        his delirious brain, had become the ideal of the nations which had
        known the writings of Plato and Cicero and the lives of Socrates and

        related of one monastery in the desert, that the monks suffered
        greatly from want of water to drink; but at the prayer of the abbot
        Theodosius a copious stream was produced. But soon some monks,
        tempted by the abundant supply, diverged from their old austerity,
        and persuaded the abbot to avail himself of the stream for the
        construction of a bath. The bath was made. Once, and once only, did
        the monks enjoy their ablutions, when the stream ceased to flow.
        Prayers, tears, and fastings were in vain. A whole year passed. At
        last the abbot destroyed the bath, which was the object of the Divine
        displeasure, and the waters flowed afresh.<a id="noteref_248" name=

        all the evidences of the loathsome excesses to which this spirit was
        carried, the life of St. Simeon Stylites is probably the most
        remarkable. It would be difficult to conceive a more horrible or
        disgusting picture than is given of the penances by which that saint
        commenced his ascetic career. He had bound a rope around him so that
        it became imbedded <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg
        112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in
        his flesh, which putrefied around it. <span class="tei tei-q">“A
        horrible stench, intolerable to the bystanders, exhaled from his body
        and worms dropped from him whenever he moved, and they filled his
        bed.”</span> Sometimes he left the monastery and slept in a dry well,
        inhabited, it is said, by dæmons. He built successively three
        pillars, the last being sixty feet high and scarcely two cubits in
        circumference, and on this pillar, during thirty years, he remained
        exposed to every change of climate, ceaselessly and rapidly bending
        his body in prayer almost to the level of his feet. A spectator
        attempted to number these rapid motions, but desisted from weariness
        when he had counted 1,244. For a whole year, we are told, St. Simeon
        stood upon one leg, the other being covered with hideous ulcers,
        while his biographer was commissioned to stand by his side, to pick
        up the worms that fell from his body, and to replace them in the
        sores, the saint saying to the worm, <span class="tei tei-q">“Eat
        what God has given you.”</span> From every quarter pilgrims of every
        degree thronged to do him homage. A crowd of prelates followed him to
        the grave. A brilliant star is said to have shone miraculously over
        his pillar; the general voice of mankind pronounced him to be the
        highest model of a Christian saint; and several other anchorites
        imitated or emulated his penances.<a id="noteref_249" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is, if I
        mistake not, no department of literature the importance of which is
        more inadequately realised than the lives of the saints. Even where
        they have no direct historical value, they have a moral value of the
        very highest order. They may not tell us with accuracy what men did
        at particular epochs; but they display with the utmost vividness what
        they thought and felt, their measure of probability, and their ideal
        of excellence. Decrees of councils, elaborate treatises of
        theologians, creeds, liturgies, and canons, are all but <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the husks of religious history. They
        reveal what was professed and argued before the world, but not that
        which was realised in the imagination or enshrined in the heart. The
        history of art, which in its ruder day reflected with delicate
        fidelity the fleeting images of an anthropomorphic age, is in this
        respect invaluable; but still more important is that vast Christian
        mythology, which grew up spontaneously from the intellectual
        condition of the time, included all its dearest hopes, wishes,
        ideals, and imaginings, and constituted, during many centuries, the
        popular literature of Christendom. In the case of the saints of the
        deserts, there can be no question that the picture—which is drawn
        chiefly by eye-witnesses—however grotesque may be some of its
        details, is in its leading features historically true. It is true
        that self-torture was for some centuries regarded as the chief
        measure of human excellence, that tens of thousands of the most
        devoted men fled to the desert to reduce themselves by maceration
        nearly to the condition of the brute, and that this odious
        superstition had acquired an almost absolute ascendancy in the ethics
        of the age. The examples of asceticism I have cited are but a few out
        of many hundreds, and volumes might be written, and have been
        written, detailing them. Till the reform of St. Benedict, the ideal
        was on the whole unchanged. The Western monks, from the conditions of
        their climate, were constitutionally incapable of rivalling the
        abstinence of the Egyptian anchorites; but their conception of
        supreme excellence was much the same, and they laboured to compensate
        for their inferiority in penances by claiming some superiority in
        miracles. From the time of St. Pachomius, the cœnobitic life was
        adopted by most monks; but the Eastern monasteries, with the
        important exception of a vow of obedience, differed little from a
        collection of hermitages. They were in the deserts; the monks
        commonly lived in separate cells; they kept silence at their repasts;
        they rivalled one another in the extravagance of their penances. A
        few feeble efforts were indeed made by <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> St. Jerome and others to moderate austerities,
        which frequently led to insanity and suicide, to check the turbulence
        of certain wandering monks, who were accustomed to defy the
        ecclesiastical authorities, and especially to suppress monastic
        mendicancy, which had appeared prominently among some heretical
        sects. The orthodox monks commonly employed themselves in weaving
        mats of palm-leaves; but, living in the deserts, with no wants, they
        speedily sank into a listless apathy; and the most admired were those
        who, like Simeon Stylites, and the hermit John, of whom I have
        already spoken, were most exclusively devoted to their superstition.
        Diversities of individual character were, however, vividly displayed.
        Many anchorites, without knowledge, passions, or imagination, having
        fled from servile toil to the calm of the wilderness, passed the long
        hours in sleep or in a mechanical routine of prayer, and their inert
        and languid existences, prolonged to the extreme of old age, closed
        at last by a tranquil and almost animal death. Others made their
        cells by the clear fountains and clustering palm-trees of some oasis
        in the desert, and a blooming garden arose beneath their toil. The
        numerous monks who followed St. Serapion devoted themselves largely
        to agriculture, and sent shiploads of corn for the benefit of the
        poor.<a id="noteref_250" name="noteref_250" href=

        old hermit it is related that, such was the cheerfulness of his mind,

        life, and the dread of spiritual enemies, and of that death which his

        although in an age when the passion for asceticism was general, many
        scholars became ascetics, the great majority of the early monks
        appear to have been men who were not only absolutely ignorant
        themselves, but who also looked upon learning with positive
        disfavour. St. Antony, the true founder of monachism, refused when a
        boy to learn letters, because it would bring him into too great
        intercourse with other boys.<a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With such men,
        living such a life, visions and miracles were necessarily habitual.
        All the elements of hallucination were there. Ignorant and
        superstitious, believing as a matter of religious conviction that
        countless dæmons filled the air, attributing every fluctuation of his
        temperament, and every exceptional phenomenon in surrounding nature,
        to spiritual agency; delirious, too, from solitude and long continued
        austerities, the hermit soon mistook for palpable realities the
        phantoms of his brain. In the ghastly gloom of the sepulchre, where,
        amid mouldering corpses, he took up his abode; in the long hours of
        the night of penance, when the desert wind sobbed around his lonely
        cell, and the cries of wild <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg

        beasts were borne upon his ear, visible forms of lust or terror
        appeared to haunt him, and strange dramas were enacted by those who
        were contending for his soul. An imagination strained to the utmost
        limit, acting upon a frame attenuated and diseased by macerations,
        produced bewildering psychological phenomena, paroxysms of
        conflicting passions, sudden alternations of joy and anguish, which
        he regarded as manifestly supernatural. Sometimes, in the very
        ecstasy of his devotion, the memory of old scenes would crowd upon
        his mind. The shady groves and soft voluptuous gardens of his native
        city would arise, and, kneeling alone upon the burning sand, he
        seemed to see around him the fair groups of dancing-girls, on whose
        warm, undulating limbs and wanton smiles his youthful eyes had too
        fondly dwelt. Sometimes his temptation sprang from remembered sounds.
        The sweet, licentious songs of other days came floating on his ear,
        and his heart was thrilled with the passions of the past. And then
        the scene would change. As his lips were murmuring the psalter, his
        imagination, fired perhaps by the music of some martial psalm,
        depicted the crowded amphitheatre. The throng and passion and mingled
        cries of eager thousands were present to his mind, and the fierce joy
        of the gladiators passed through the tumult of his dream.<a id=

        simplest incident came at last to suggest diabolical influence. An
        old hermit, weary and fainting upon his journey, once thought how
        refreshing would be a draught of the honey of wild bees <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the desert. At that moment his eye
        fell upon a rock on which they had built a hive. He passed on with a
        shudder and an exorcism, for he believed it to be a temptation of the
        devil.<a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href=
        "#note_262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a> But
        most terrible of all were the struggles of young and ardent men,
        through whose veins the hot blood of passion continually flowed,
        physically incapable of a life of celibacy, and with all that
        proneness to hallucination which a southern sun engenders, who were
        borne on the wave of enthusiasm to the desert life. In the arms of
        Syrian or African brides, whose soft eyes answered love with love,
        they might have sunk to rest, but in the lonely wilderness no peace
        could ever visit their souls. The Lives of the Saints paint with an
        appalling vividness the agonies of their struggle. Multiplying with
        frantic energy the macerations of the body, beating their breasts
        with anguish, the tears for ever streaming from their eyes, imagining
        themselves continually haunted by ever-changing forms of deadly
        beauty, which acquired a greater vividness from the very passion with
        which they resisted them, their struggles not unfrequently ended in
        insanity and in suicide. It is related that when St. Pachomius and
        St. Palæmon were conversing together in the desert, a young monk,
        with his countenance distracted with madness, rushed into their
        presence, and, in a voice broken with convulsive sobs, poured out his
        tale of sorrows. A woman, he said, had entered his cell, had seduced
        him by her artifices, and then vanished miraculously in the air,
        leaving him half dead upon the ground;—and then with a wild shriek
        the monk broke away from the saintly listeners. Impelled, as they
        imagined, by an evil spirit, he rushed across the desert, till he
        arrived at the next village, and there, leaping into the open furnace
        of the public baths, he perished in the flames.<a id="noteref_263"

        stories were told <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg
        119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        among the monks of revulsions of passion even in the most advanced.
        Of one monk especially, who had long been regarded as a pattern of
        asceticism, but who had suffered himself to fall into that
        self-complacency which was very common among the anchorites, it was
        told that one evening a fainting woman appeared at the door of his
        cell, and implored him to give her shelter, and not permit her to be
        devoured by the wild beasts. In an evil hour he yielded to her
        prayer. With all the aspect of profound reverence she won his
        regards, and at last ventured to lay her hand upon him. But that
        touch convulsed his frame. Passions long slumbering and forgotten
        rushed with impetuous fury through his veins. In a paroxysm of fierce
        love, he sought to clasp the woman to his heart, but she vanished
        from his sight, and a chorus of dæmons, with peals of laughter,
        exulted over his fall. The sequel of the story, as it is told by the
        monkish writer, is, I think, of a very high order of artistic merit.
        The fallen hermit did not seek, as might have been expected, by
        penance and prayers to renew his purity. That moment of passion and
        of shame had revealed in him a new nature, and severed him
        irrevocably from the hopes and feelings of the ascetic life. The fair
        form that had arisen upon his dream, though he knew it to be a
        deception luring him to destruction, still governed his heart. He
        fled from the desert, plunged anew into the world, avoided all
        intercourse with the monks, and followed the light of that ideal
        beauty even into the jaws of hell.<a id="noteref_264" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Anecdotes of this
        kind, circulated among the monks, contributed to heighten the
        feelings of terror with which they regarded all communication with
        the other sex. But to avoid such communication was sometimes very
        difficult. Few things are more striking, in the early historians of
        the movement we are considering, than the manner in which narratives
        of the deepest tragical interest alternate with extremely whimsical
        accounts of the profound admiration with which the female devotees
        regarded the most austere anchorites, and the unwearied perseverance
        with which they endeavoured to force themselves upon their notice.
        Some women seem in this respect to have been peculiarly fortunate.
        St. Melania, who devoted a great portion of her fortune to the monks,
        accompanied by the historian Rufinus, made, near the end of the
        fourth century, a long pilgrimage through the Syrian and Egyptian
        hermitages.<a id="noteref_265" name="noteref_265" href=

        with many of the hermits it was a rule never to look upon the face of
        any woman, and the number of years they had escaped this
        contamination was commonly stated as a conspicuous proof of their
        excellence. St. Basil would only speak to a woman under extreme
        necessity.<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href=

        tribune was sent by his wife on a pilgrimage to St. John the hermit
        to implore him to allow her to visit him, her desire being so intense
        that she would probably, in the opinion of her husband, die if it
        were ungratified. At last the hermit told his suppliant that he would
        that night visit his wife when she was in bed in her house. The
        tribune brought this strange message to his wife, who <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121"

        Roman girl made a pilgrimage from Italy to Alexandria, to look upon
        the face and obtain the prayers of St. Arsenius, into whose presence
        she forced herself. Quailing beneath his rebuffs, she flung herself
        at his feet, imploring him with tears to grant her only request—to
        remember her, and to pray for her. <span class="tei tei-q">“Remember
        you!”</span> cried the indignant saint; <span class="tei tei-q">“it
        shall be the prayer of my life that I may forget you.”</span> The
        poor girl sought consolation from the Archbishop of Alexandria, who
        comforted her by assuring her that, though she belonged to the sex by
        which dæmons commonly tempt saints, he doubted not the hermit would
        pray for her soul, though he would try to forget her face.<a id=

        Sometimes this female enthusiasm took another and a more subtle form,
        and on more than one occasion women were known to attire themselves
        as men, and to pass their lives undisturbed as anchorites. Among
        others, St. Pelagia, who had been the most beautiful, and one of the
        most dangerously seductive actresses of Antioch, having been somewhat
        strangely converted, was appointed by the bishops to live in penance
        with an elderly virgin of irreproachable piety; but, impelled, we are
        told, by her desire for a more austere life, she fled from her
        companion, assumed a male attire, took refuge among the monks on the
        Mount of Olives, and, with something of the skill of her old
        profession, supported her feigned character so consistently that she
        acquired great renown, and it was only (it is said) after her death
        that the saints discovered who had been living among them.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The foregoing
        anecdotes and observations will, I hope, have given a sufficiently
        clear idea of the general nature of the monastic life in its earliest
        phase, and also of the writings it produced. We may now proceed to
        examine the ways in which this mode of life affected both the ideal
        type and the realised condition of Christian morals. And in the first
        place, it is manifest that the proportion of virtues was altered. If
        an impartial person were to glance over the ethics of the New
        Testament, and were asked what was the central and distinctive virtue
        to which the sacred writers most continually referred, he would
        doubtless answer that it was that which is described as love,
        charity, or philanthropy. If he were to apply a similar scrutiny to
        the writings of the fourth and fifth centuries, he would answer that
        the cardinal virtue of the religious type was not love, but chastity.
        And this chastity, which was regarded as the ideal state, was not the
        purity of an undefiled marriage. It was the absolute suppression of
        the whole sensual side of our nature. The chief form of virtue, the
        central conception of the saintly life, was a perpetual struggle
        against all carnal impulses, by men who altogether refused the
        compromise of marriage. From this fact, if I mistake not, some
        interesting and important consequences may be deduced.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
        place, religion gradually assumed a very sombre hue. The business of
        the saint was to eradicate a natural appetite, to attain a condition
        which was emphatically abnormal. The depravity of human nature,
        especially <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg
        123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        essential evil of the body, was felt with a degree of intensity that
        could never have been attained by moralists who were occupied mainly
        with transient or exceptional vices, such as envy, anger, or cruelty.
        And in addition to the extreme inveteracy of the appetite which it
        was desired to eradicate, it should be remembered that a somewhat
        luxurious and indulgent life, even when that indulgence is not itself
        distinctly evil, even when it has a tendency to mollify the
        character, has naturally the effect of strengthening the animal
        passions, and is therefore directly opposed to the ascetic ideal. The
        consequence of this was first of all a very deep sense of the
        habitual and innate depravity of human nature; and, in the next
        place, a very strong association of the idea of pleasure with that of
        vice. All this necessarily flowed from the supreme value placed upon
        virginity. The tone of calm and joyousness that characterises Greek
        philosophy, the almost complete absence of all sense of struggle and
        innate sin that it displays, is probably in a very large degree to be
        ascribed to the fact that, in the department of morals we are
        considering, Greek moralists made no serious efforts to improve our
        nature, and Greek public opinion acquiesced, without scandal, in an
        almost boundless indulgence of illicit pleasures.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while the
        great prominence at this time given to the conflicts of the ascetic
        life threw a dark shade upon the popular estimate of human nature, it
        contributed, I think, very largely to sustain and deepen that strong
        conviction of the freedom of the human will which the Catholic Church
        has always so strenuously upheld; for there is, probably, no other
        form of moral conflict in which men are so habitually and so keenly
        sensible of that distinction between our will and our desires, upon
        the reality of which all moral freedom ultimately depends. It had
        also, I imagine, another result, which it is difficult to describe
        with the same precision. What may be called a strong animal nature—a
        nature, that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg
        124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is,
        in which the passions are in vigorous, and at the same time healthy,
        action—is that in which we should most naturally expect to find
        several moral qualities. Good humour, frankness, generosity, active
        courage, sanguine energy, buoyancy of temper, are the usual and
        appropriate accompaniments of a vigorous animal temperament, and they
        are much more rarely found either in natures that are essentially
        feeble and effeminate, or in natures which have been artificially
        emasculated by penances, distorted from their original tendency, and
        habitually held under severe control. The ideal type of Catholicism
        being, on account of the supreme value placed upon virginity, of the
        latter kind, the qualities I have mentioned have always ranked very
        low in the Catholic conceptions of excellence, and the steady
        tendency of Protestant and industrial civilisation has been to
        elevate them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I do not know
        whether the reader will regard these speculations—which I advance
        with some diffidence—as far-fetched and fanciful. Our knowledge of
        the physical antecedents of different moral qualities is so scanty
        that it is difficult to speak on these matters with much confidence;
        but few persons, I think, can have failed to observe that the
        physical temperaments I have described differ not simply in the one
        great fact of the intensity of the animal passions, but also in the
        aptitude of each to produce a distinct moral type, or, in other
        words, in the harmony of each with several qualities, both good and
        evil. A doctrine, therefore, which connects one of these two
        temperaments indissolubly with the moral ideal, affects the
        appreciation of a large number of moral qualities. But whatever may
        be thought of the moral results springing from the physical
        temperament which asceticism produced, there can be little
        controversy as to the effects springing from the condition of life
        which it enjoined. Severance from the interests and affections of all
        around him was the chief object of the anchorite, and the first
        consequence <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg
        125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        the prominence of asceticism was a profound discredit thrown upon the
        domestic virtues.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The extent to
        which this discredit was carried, the intense hardness of heart and
        ingratitude manifested by the saints towards those who were bound to
        them by the closest of earthly ties, is known to few who have not
        studied the original literature on the subject. These things are
        commonly thrown into the shade by those modern sentimentalists who
        delight in idealising the devotees of the past. To break by his
        ingratitude the heart of the mother who had borne him, to persuade
        the wife who adored him that it was her duty to separate from him for
        ever, to abandon his children, uncared for and beggars, to the
        mercies of the world, was regarded by the true hermit as the most
        acceptable offering he could make to his God. His business was to
        save his own soul. The serenity of his devotion would be impaired by
        the discharge of the simplest duties to his family. Evagrius, when a
        hermit in the desert, received, after a long interval, letters from
        his father and mother. He could not bear that the equable tenor of
        his thoughts should be disturbed by the recollection of those who
        loved him, so he cast the letters unread into the fire.<a id=

        named Mutius, accompanied by his only child, a little boy of eight
        years old, abandoned his possessions and demanded admission into a
        monastery. The monks received him, but they proceeded to discipline
        his heart. <span class="tei tei-q">“He had already forgotten that he
        was rich; he must next be taught to forget that he was a

        from him, clothed in dirty rags, subjected to every form of gross and
        wanton hardship, beaten, spurned, and ill treated. Day after day the
        father was compelled to look upon his boy wasting away with sorrow,
        his once happy countenance for ever stained with tears, distorted by
        sobs of anguish. But yet, says the admiring biographer, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“though he saw this day by day, such was his love for
        Christ, and for the virtue of obedience, that the father's heart was
        rigid and unmoved. He thought little of the tears of his child. He
        was anxious only for his own humility and perfection in
        virtue.”</span><a id="noteref_273" name="noteref_273" href=

        the abbot told him to take his child and throw it into the river. He
        proceeded, without a murmur or apparent pang, to obey, and it was
        only at the last moment that the monks interposed, and on the very
        brink of the river saved the child. Mutius afterwards rose to a high
        position among the ascetics, and was justly regarded as having
        displayed in great perfection the temper of a saint.<a id=

        inhabitant of Thebes once came to the abbot Sisoes, and asked to be

        "tei tei-q">“Take your son,”</span> rejoined the old man,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and throw him into the river, and then you
        may become a monk.”</span> The father hastened to fulfil the command,
        and the deed was almost consummated when a messenger sent by Sisoes
        revoked the order.<a id="noteref_275" name="noteref_275" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes the same
        lesson was taught under the form of a miracle. A man had once
        deserted his three children to become a monk. Three years after, he
        determined to bring them into the monastery, but, on returning to his
        home, found that the two eldest had died during his absence. He came
        to his abbot, bearing in his arms his youngest child, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> who was still little more than an infant.
        The abbot turned to him and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you
        love this child?”</span> The father answered, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span> Again the abbot said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Do you love it dearly?”</span> The father answered as
        before. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then take the child,”</span> said
        the abbot, <span class="tei tei-q">“and throw it into the fire upon
        yonder hearth.”</span> The father did as he was commanded, and the

        was especially in their dealings with their female relations that
        this aspect of the monastic character was vividly displayed. In this
        case the motive was not simply to mortify family affections—it was
        also to guard against the possible danger resulting from the presence
        of a woman. The fine flower of that saintly purity might have been
        disturbed by the sight of a mother's or a sister's face. The ideal of
        one age appears sometimes too grotesque for the caricature of

        compared with the narratives that are gravely propounded in the Lives
        of the Saints. When the abbot Sisoes had become a very old, feeble,
        and decrepit man, his disciples exhorted him to leave the desert for
        an inhabited country. Sisoes seemed to yield; but he stipulated, as a
        necessary condition, that in his new abode he should never be
        compelled to encounter the peril and perturbation of looking on a
        woman's face. To such a nature, of course, the desert alone was
        suitable, and the old man was suffered to die in peace.<a id=

        arrived at a bridgeless stream, it became necessary for him to carry
        her across. To her surprise, he began carefully wrapping up his hands
        in cloths; and upon her asking the reason, he explained that he was
        alarmed lest he should be unfortunate enough to touch her, and
        thereby disturb the equilibrium of his nature.<a id="noteref_279"

        him that she might look upon his face once more before she died. On
        his persistent refusal, she declared that she would make a pilgrimage
        to him in the desert. The alarmed and perplexed saint at last wrote
        to her, promising to visit her if she would engage to relinquish her
        design. He went to her in disguise, received a cup of water from her
        hands, and came away without being discovered. She wrote to him,
        reproaching him with not having fulfilled his promise. He answered
        her that he had indeed visited her, that <span class="tei tei-q">“by

        that she must never see him again.<a id="noteref_280" name=

        ingenious device. He went to his mother with his face disguised and

        Pœmen and his six brothers had all deserted their mother to cultivate
        the perfections of an ascetic life. But ingratitude can seldom quench
        the love of a mother's heart, and the old woman, now bent by
        infirmities, went alone into the Egyptian desert to see once more the
        children she so dearly loved. She caught sight of them as they were
        about to leave their cell for the church, but they immediately ran
        back into the cell, and, before her tottering steps could reach it,
        one of her sons rushed forward and closed the door in her face. She
        remained outside weeping bitterly. St. Pœmen then, coming to the
        door, but without opening it, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why do
        you, who are already stricken with age, pour forth such cries and
        lamentations?”</span> But she, recognising the voice of her son,
        answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is because I long to see you,
        my sons. What harm could it do you that I should see you? Am I not
        your mother? did I not give you suck? I am now an old and wrinkled
        woman, and my heart is troubled at the sound of your
        voices.”</span><a id="noteref_284" name="noteref_284" href=

        saintly brothers, however, refused to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> open their door. They told their mother that
        she would see them after death; and the biographer says she at last
        went away contented with the prospect. St. Simeon Stylites, in this
        as in other respects, stands in the first line. He had been
        passionately loved by his parents, and, if we may believe his
        eulogist and biographer, he began his saintly career by breaking the
        heart of his father, who died of grief at his flight. His mother,
        however, lingered on. Twenty-seven years after his disappearance, at
        a period when his austerities had made him famous, she heard for the
        first time where he was, and hastened to visit him. But all her
        labour was in vain. No woman was admitted within the precincts of his
        dwelling, and he refused to permit her even to look upon his face.
        Her entreaties and tears were mingled with words of bitter and
        eloquent reproach.<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href=
        "#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“My son,”</span> she is represented as having
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“why have you done this? I bore you in
        my womb, and you have wrung my soul with grief. I gave you milk from
        my breast, you have filled my eyes with tears. For the kisses I gave
        you, you have given me the anguish of a broken heart; for all that I
        have done and suffered for you, you have repaid me by the most cruel
        wrongs.”</span> At last the saint sent a message to tell her that she
        would soon see him. Three days and three nights she had wept and
        entreated in vain, and now, exhausted with grief and age and
        privation, she sank feebly to the ground and breathed her last sigh
        before that inhospitable door. Then for the first time the saint,
        accompanied by his followers, came out. He shed some pious
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131"
        id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> tears over the corpse of his
        murdered mother, and offered up a prayer consigning her soul to
        heaven. Perhaps it was but fancy, perhaps life was not yet wholly
        extinct, perhaps the story is but the invention of the biographer;
        but a faint motion—which appears to have been regarded as
        miraculous—is said to have passed over her prostrate form. Simeon
        once more commended her soul to heaven, and then, amid the admiring
        murmurs of his disciples, the saintly matricide returned to his
        devotions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The glaring
        mendacity that characterises the Lives of the Catholic Saints,
        probably to a greater extent than any other important branch of
        existing literature, makes it not unreasonable to hope that many of
        the foregoing anecdotes represent much less events that actually took
        place than ideal pictures generated by the enthusiasm of the
        chroniclers. They are not, however, on that account the less
        significant of the moral conceptions which the ascetic period had
        created. The ablest men in the Christian community vied with one
        another in inculcating as the highest form of duty the abandonment of
        social ties and the mortification of domestic affections. A few faint
        restrictions were indeed occasionally made. Much—on which I shall
        hereafter touch—was written on the liberty of husbands and wives
        deserting one another; and something was written on the cases of
        children forsaking or abandoning their parents. At first, those who,
        when children, were devoted to the monasteries by their parents,
        without their own consent, were permitted, when of mature age, to
        return to the world; and this liberty was taken from them for the
        first time by the fourth Council of Toledo, in <span class=

        cases of this kind of rebellion against parental authority were
        continually recounted with admiration in the Lives of the

        the leading Fathers, and virtually sanctioned by a law of Justinian,
        which deprived parents of the power of either restraining their

        done so without their consent.<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288"

        The touching language is still preserved, in which the mother of

        are still more worthy of praise who do so against the wishes, of
        their parents; and he proceeded to show how small were the penalties

        Ambrose showed that, even in this world, they might not be

        intention, one of those present tried to move her by the memory of
        her dead father, asking whether, if he were still <span class=

        purpose he died, that he should not throw any obstacle in my
        way.”</span> Her words were more than an answer; they were an oracle.
        The indiscreet questioner almost immediately died, and the relations,
        shocked by the manifest providence, desisted from their opposition,
        and even implored the young saint to accomplish her design.<a id=

        carefully inculcated that all money given or bequeathed to the poor,

        Usually, however, to outrage the affections of the nearest and

        on the threshold before you, pass on over your father's body. Fly

        love for his parents, and one night stole out secretly to visit them.
        But the judgment of God soon marked the enormity of the offence. On
        coming back to the monastery, he died that very day, and when he was
        buried, the earth refused to receive so heinous a criminal. His body
        was repeatedly thrown up from the grave, and it was only suffered to

        he both counselled and planned.<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305"
        href="#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a> As the
        first enthusiasm of asceticism died away, what was lost in influence
        by the father was gained by the priest. The confessional made
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136"
        id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> this personage the confidant
        in the most delicate secrets of domestic life. The supremacy of
        authority, of sympathy, and sometimes even of affection, passed away
        beyond the domestic circle, and, by establishing an absolute
        authority over the most secret thoughts and feelings of nervous and
        credulous women, the priests laid the foundation of the empire of the
        world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The picture I have
        drawn of the inroads made in the first period of asceticism upon the
        domestic affections, tells, I think, its own story, and I shall only
        add a very few words of comment. That it is necessary for many men
        who are pursuing a truly heroic course to break loose from the
        trammels which those about them would cast over their actions or
        their opinions, and that this severance often constitutes at once one
        of the noblest and one of the most painful incidents in their career,
        are unquestionable truths; but the examples of such occasional and
        exceptional sacrifices, endured for some great unselfish end, cannot
        be compared with the conduct of those who regarded the mortification
        of domestic love as in itself a form of virtue, and whose ends were
        mainly or exclusively selfish. The sufferings endured by the ascetic
        who fled from his relations were often, no doubt, very great. Many
        anecdotes remain to show that warm and affectionate hearts sometimes
        beat under the cold exterior of the monk;<a id="noteref_306" name=
        "noteref_306" href="#note_306"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a> and St.
        Jerome, in one of his letters, remarked, with much complacency and
        congratulation, that the very bitterest pang of captivity is simply
        this irrevocable <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg
        137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        separation which the superstition he preached induced multitudes to
        inflict upon themselves. But if, putting aside the intrinsic
        excellence of an act, we attempt to estimate the nobility of the
        agent, we must consider not only the cost of what he did, but also
        the motive which induced him to do it. It is this last consideration
        which renders it impossible for us to place the heroism of the
        ascetic on the same level with that of the great patriots of Greece
        or Rome. A man may be as truly selfish about the next world as about
        this. Where an overpowering dread of future torments, or an intense
        realisation of future happiness, is the leading motive of action, the
        theological virtue of faith may be present, but the ennobling quality
        of disinterestedness is assuredly absent. In our day, when pictures
        of rewards and punishments beyond the grave act but feebly upon the
        imagination, a religious motive is commonly an unselfish motive; but
        it has not always been so, and it was undoubtedly not so in the first
        period of asceticism. The terrors of a future judgment drove the monk
        into the desert, and the whole tenor of the ascetic life, while
        isolating him from human sympathies, fostered an intense, though it
        may be termed a religious, selfishness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The effect of the
        mortification of the domestic affections upon the general character
        was probably very pernicious. The family circle is the appointed
        sphere, not only for the performance of manifest duties, but also for
        the cultivation of the affections; and the extreme ferocity which so
        often characterised the ascetic was the natural consequence of the
        discipline he imposed upon himself. Severed from all other ties, the
        monks clung with a desperate tenacity to their opinions and to their
        Church, and hated those who dissented from them with all the
        intensity of men whose whole lives were concentrated on a single
        subject, whose ignorance and bigotry prevented them from conceiving
        the possibility of any good thing in opposition to themselves, and
        who had made it a main object of their discipline to eradicate all
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138"
        id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> natural sympathies and
        affections. We may reasonably attribute to the fierce biographer the
        words of burning hatred of all heretics which St. Athanasius puts in
        the mouth of the dying patriarch of the hermits;<a id="noteref_307"
        name="noteref_307" href="#note_307"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a> but
        ecclesiastical history, and especially the writings of the later
        Pagans, abundantly prove that the sentiment was a general one. To the
        Christian bishops it is mainly due that the wide and general, though
        not perfect, recognition of religious liberty in the Roman
        legislation was replaced by laws of the most minute and stringent
        intolerance. To the monks, acting as the executive of an omnipresent,
        intolerant, and aggressive clergy, is due an administrative change,
        perhaps even more important than the legislative change that had
        preceded it. The system of conniving at, neglecting, or despising
        forms of worship that were formally prohibited, which had been so
        largely practised by the sceptical Pagans, and under the lax police
        system of the Empire, and which is so important a fact in the history
        of the rise of Christianity, was absolutely destroyed. Wandering in
        bands through the country, the monks were accustomed to burn the
        temples, to break the idols, to overthrow the altars, to engage in
        fierce conflicts with the peasants, who often defended with desperate
        courage the shrines of their gods. It would be impossible to conceive
        men more fitted for the task. Their fierce fanaticism, their
        persuasion that every idol was tenanted by a literal dæmon, and their
        belief that death incurred in this iconoclastic crusade was a form of
        martyrdom, made them careless of all consequences to themselves,
        while the reverence that attached to their profession rendered it
        scarcely possible for the civil power to arrest them. Men who had
        learnt to look with indifference on the tears of a broken-hearted
        mother, and whose ideal was indissolubly connected with the
        degradation of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg
        139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        body, were but little likely to be moved either by the pathos of old
        associations, and of reverent, though mistaken, worship, or by the
        grandeur of the Serapeum, or of the noble statues of Phidias and
        Praxiteles. Sometimes the civil power ordered the reconstruction of
        Jewish synagogues or heretical churches which had been illegally
        destroyed; but the doctrine was early maintained that such a
        reconstruction was a deadly sin. Under Julian some Christians
        suffered martyrdom sooner than be parties to it; and St. Ambrose from
        the pulpit of Milan, and Simeon Stylites from his desert pillar,
        united in denouncing Theodosius, who had been guilty of issuing this
        command.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another very
        important moral result to which asceticism largely contributed was
        the depression and sometimes almost the extinction of the civic
        virtues. A candid examination will show that the Christian
        civilisations have been as inferior to the Pagan ones in civic and
        intellectual virtues as they have been superior to them in the
        virtues of humanity and of chastity. We have already seen that one
        remarkable feature of the intellectual movement that preceded
        Christianity was the gradual decadence of patriotism. In the early
        days both of Greece and Rome, the first duty enforced was that of a
        man to his country. This was the rudimentary or cardinal virtue of
        the moral type. It gave the tone to the whole system of ethics, and
        different moral qualities were valued chiefly in proportion to their
        tendency to form illustrious citizens. The destruction of this spirit
        in the Roman Empire was due, as we have seen, to two causes—one of
        them being political and the other intellectual. The political cause
        was the amalgamation of the different nations in one great despotism,
        which gave indeed an ample field for personal and intellectual
        freedom, but extinguished the sentiment of nationality and closed
        almost every sphere of political activity. The intellectual cause,
        which was by no means unconnected with the political one, was the
        growing ascendancy <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg
        140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        Oriental philosophies, which dethroned the active Stoicism of the
        early Empire, and placed its ideal of excellence in contemplative
        virtues and in elaborate purifications. By this decline of the
        patriotic sentiment the progress of the new faith was greatly aided.
        In all matters of religion the opinions of men are governed much more
        by their sympathies than by their judgments; and it rarely or never
        happens that a religion which is opposed to a strong national
        sentiment, as Christianity was in Judea, as Catholicism and
        Episcopalian Protestantism have been in Scotland, and as Anglicanism
        is even now in Ireland, can win the acceptance of the people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The relations of
        Christianity to the sentiment of patriotism were from the first very
        unfortunate. While the Christians were, for obvious reasons,
        completely separated from the national spirit of Judea, they found
        themselves equally at variance with the lingering remnants of Roman
        patriotism. Rome was to them the power of Antichrist, and its
        overthrow the necessary prelude to the millennial reign. They formed
        an illegal organisation, directly opposed to the genius of the
        Empire, anticipating its speedy destruction, looking back with
        something more than despondency to the fate of the heroes who adorned
        its past, and refusing resolutely to participate in those national
        spectacles which were the symbols and the expressions of patriotic
        feeling. Though scrupulously averse to all rebellion, they rarely
        concealed their sentiments, and the whole tendency of their teaching
        was to withdraw men as far as possible both from the functions and
        the enthusiasm of public life. It was at once their confession and
        their boast, that no interests were more indifferent to them than
        those of their country.<a id="noteref_308" name="noteref_308" href=
        "#note_308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a> They
        regarded the lawfulness of taking arms as very questionable,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141"
        id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and all those proud and
        aspiring qualities that constitute the distinctive beauty of the
        soldier's character as emphatically unchristian. Their home and their
        interests were in another world, and, provided only they were
        unmolested in their worship, they avowed with frankness, long after
        the Empire had become Christian, that it was a matter of indifference
        to them under what rule they lived.<a id="noteref_309" name=
        "noteref_309" href="#note_309"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        Asceticism, drawing all the enthusiasm of Christendom to the desert
        life, and elevating as an ideal the extreme and absolute abnegation
        of all patriotism,<a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310" href=
        "#note_310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a> formed
        the culmination of the movement, and was undoubtedly one cause of the
        downfall of the Roman Empire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are,
        probably, few subjects on which popular judgments are commonly more
        erroneous than upon the relations <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> between positive religions and moral
        enthusiasm. Religions have, no doubt, a most real power of evoking a
        latent energy which, without their existence, would never have been
        called into action; but their influence is on the whole probably more
        attractive than creative. They supply the channel in which moral
        enthusiasm flows, the banner under which it is enlisted, the mould in
        which it is cast, the ideal to which it tends. The first idea which
        the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“a very good man”</span> would
        have suggested to an early Roman would probably have been that of
        great and distinguished patriotism, and the passion and interest of
        such a man in his country's cause were in direct proportion to his
        moral elevation. Ascetic Christianity decisively diverted moral
        enthusiasm into another channel, and the civic virtues, in
        consequence, necessarily declined. The extinction of all public
        spirit, the base treachery and corruption pervading every department
        of the Government, the cowardice of the army, the despicable
        frivolity of character that led the people of Treves, when fresh from
        their burning city, to call for theatres and circuses, and the people
        of Roman Carthage to plunge wildly into the excitement of the chariot
        races, on the very day when their city succumbed beneath the
        Vandal;<a id="noteref_311" name="noteref_311" href=
        "#note_311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a> all
        these things coexisted with extraordinary displays of ascetic and of
        missionary devotion. The genius and the virtue that might have
        defended the Empire were engaged in fierce disputes about the
        Pelagian controversy, at the very time when Alaric was encircling
        Rome with his armies,<a id="noteref_312" name="noteref_312" href=
        "#note_312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">312</span></span></a> and
        there was no subtlety of theological metaphysics which did not kindle
        a deeper interest in the Christian leaders than the throes of their
        expiring country. The moral enthusiasm that in other days would have
        fired the armies of Rome with <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> an invincible valour, impelled thousands to
        abandon their country and their homes, and consume the weary hours in
        a long routine of useless and horrible macerations. When the Goths
        had captured Rome, St. Augustine, as we have seen, pointed with a
        just pride to the Christian Church, which remained an unviolated
        sanctuary during the horrors of the sack, as a proof that a new
        spirit of sanctity and of reverence had descended upon the world. The
        Pagan, in his turn, pointed to what he deemed a not less significant
        fact—the golden statues of Valour and of Fortune were melted down to
        pay the ransom to the conquerors.<a id="noteref_313" name=

        the Christians contemplated with an indifference that almost amounted
        to complacency what they regarded as the predicted ruin of the city
        of the fallen gods.<a id="noteref_314" name="noteref_314" href=

        more probable that they had absorbed or diverted the heroism that in
        other days would have defended it. The conquest, at a later date, of
        Egypt, by the Mohammedans, was in a great measure due to an
        invitation from the persecuted Monophysites.<a id="noteref_317" name=

        Subsequent religious wars <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg
        144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        have again and again exhibited the same phenomenon. The treachery of
        a religionist to his country no longer argued an absence of all moral
        feeling. It had become compatible with the deepest religious
        enthusiasm, and with all the courage of a martyr.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is somewhat
        difficult to form a just estimate of how far the attitude assumed by
        the Church towards the barbarian invaders has on the whole proved
        beneficial to mankind. The Empire, as we have seen, had long been,
        both morally and politically, in a condition of manifest decline; its
        fall, though it might have been retarded, could scarcely have been
        averted, and the new religion, even in its most superstitious form,
        while it did much to displace, did also much to elicit moral
        enthusiasm. It is impossible to deny that the Christian priesthood
        contributed very materially, both by their charity and by their
        arbitration, to mitigate the calamities that accompanied the
        dissolution of the Empire;<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318"
        href="#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a> and it
        is equally impossible to doubt that their political attitude greatly
        increased their power for good. Standing between the conflicting
        forces, almost indifferent to the issue, and notoriously exempt from
        the passions of the combat, they obtained with the conqueror, and
        used for the benefit of the conquered, a degree of influence they
        would never have possessed, had they been regarded as Roman patriots.
        Their attitude, however, marked a complete, and, as it has proved, a
        permanent, change in the position assigned to patriotism in the moral
        scale. It <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg
        145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> has
        occasionally happened in later times, that churches have found it for
        their interest to appeal to this sentiment in their conflict with
        opposing creeds, or that patriots have found the objects of churchmen
        in harmony with their own; and in these cases a fusion of theological
        and patriotic feeling has taken place, in which each has intensified
        the other. Such has been the effect of the conflict between the
        Spaniards and the Moors, between the Poles and the Russians, between
        the Scotch Puritans and the English Episcopalians, between the Irish
        Catholics and the English Protestants. But patriotism itself, as a
        duty, has never found any place in Christian ethics, and strong
        theological feeling has usually been directly hostile to its growth.
        Ecclesiastics have, no doubt, taken a very large share in political
        affairs, but this has been in most cases solely with the object of
        wresting them into conformity with ecclesiastical designs; and no
        other body of men have so uniformly sacrificed the interests of their
        country to the interests of their class. For the repugnance between
        the theological and the patriotic spirit, three reasons may, I think,
        be assigned. The first is that tendency of strong religious feeling
        to divert the mind from all terrestrial cares and passions, of which
        the ascetic life was the extreme expression, but which has always,
        under different forms, been manifested in the Church. The second
        arises from the fact that each form of theological opinion embodies
        itself in a visible and organised church, with a government,
        interest, and policy of its own, and a frontier often intersecting
        rather than following national boundaries; and these churches attract
        to themselves the attachment and devotion that would naturally be
        bestowed upon the country and its rulers. The third reason is, that
        the saintly and the heroic characters, which represent the ideals of
        religion and of patriotism, are generically different; for although
        they have no doubt many common elements of virtue, the distinctive
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146"
        id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> excellence of each is derived
        from a proportion or disposition of qualities altogether different
        from that of the other.<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href=
        "#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before dismissing
        this very important revolution in moral history, I may add two
        remarks. In the first place, we may observe that the relation of the
        two great schools of morals to active and political life has been
        completely changed. Among the ancients, the Stoics, who regarded
        virtue and vice as generically different from all other things,
        participated actively in public life, and made this participation one
        of the first of duties; while the Epicureans, who resolved virtue
        into utility, and esteemed happiness its supreme motive, abstained
        from public life, and taught their disciples to neglect it.
        Asceticism followed the Stoical school in teaching that virtue and
        happiness are generically different things; but it was at the same
        time eminently unfavourable to civic virtue. On the other hand, that
        great industrial movement which has arisen since the abolition of
        slavery, and which has always been essentially utilitarian in its
        spirit, has been one of the most active and influential elements of
        political progress. This change, though, as far as I know, entirely
        unnoticed by historians, constitutes, I believe, one of the great
        landmarks of moral history.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
        observation I would make relates to the estimate we form of the value
        of patriotic actions. However <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> much historians may desire to extend their
        researches to the private and domestic virtues of a people, civic
        virtues are always those which must appear most prominently in their
        pages. History is concerned only with large bodies of men. The
        systems of philosophy or religion which produce splendid results on
        the great theatre of public life are fully and easily appreciated,
        and readers and writers are both liable to give them very undue
        advantages over those systems which do not favour civic virtues, but
        exercise their beneficial influence in the more obscure fields of
        individual self-culture, domestic morals, or private charity. If
        valued by the self-sacrifice they imply, or by their effects upon
        human happiness, these last rank very high, but they scarcely appear
        in history, and they therefore seldom obtain their due weight in
        historical comparisons. Christianity has, I think, suffered
        peculiarly from this cause. Its moral action has always been much
        more powerful upon individuals than upon societies, and the spheres
        in which its superiority over other religions is most incontestable,
        are precisely those which history is least capable of realising.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In attempting to
        estimate the moral condition of the Roman and Byzantine Empires
        during the Christian period, and before the old civilisation had been
        dissolved by the barbarian or Mohammedan invasions, we must
        continually bear this last consideration in mind. We must remember,
        too, that Christianity had acquired an ascendancy among nations which
        were already deeply tainted by the inveterate vices of a corrupt and
        decaying civilisation, and also that many of the censors from whose
        pages we are obliged to form our estimate of the age were men who
        judged human frailties with all the fastidiousness of ascetics, and
        who expressed their judgments with all the declamatory exaggeration
        of the pulpit. Modern critics will probably not lay much stress upon
        the relapse of the Christians into the ordinary dress and usages of
        the luxurious society about them, upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the ridicule thrown by Christians on those who
        still adhered to the primitive austerity of the sect, or upon the
        fact that multitudes who were once mere nominal Pagans had become
        mere nominal Christians. We find, too, a frequent disposition on the
        part of moralists to single out some new form of luxury, or some
        trivial custom which they regarded as indecorous, for the most
        extravagant denunciation, and to magnify its importance in a manner
        which in a later age it is difficult even to understand. Examples of
        this kind may be found both in Pagan and in Christian writings, and
        they form an extremely curious page in the history of morals. Thus
        Juvenal exhausts his vocabulary of invective in denouncing the
        atrocious criminality of a certain noble, who in the very year of his
        consulship did not hesitate—not, it is true, by day, but at least in
        the sight of the moon and of the stars—with his own hand to drive his
        own chariot along the public road.<a id="noteref_320" name=

        Apuleius was compelled to defend himself for having eulogised
        tooth-powder, and he did so, among other ways, by arguing that nature
        has justified this form of propriety, for crocodiles were known
        periodically to leave the waters of the Nile, and to lie with open
        jaws <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name=

        were to measure the criminality of different customs by the vehemence
        of the patristic denunciations, we might almost conclude that the
        most atrocious offence of their day was the custom of wearing false
        hair, or dyeing natural hair. Clement of Alexandria questioned
        whether the validity of certain ecclesiastical ceremonies might not
        be affected by wigs; for, he asked, when the priest is placing his
        hand on the head of the person who kneels before him, if that hand is
        resting upon false hair, who is it he is really blessing? Tertullian
        shuddered at the thought that Christians might have the hair of those
        who were in hell upon their heads, and he found in the tiers of false
        hair that were in use a distinct rebellion against the assertion that
        no one can add to his stature, and, in the custom of dyeing the hair,
        a contravention of the declaration that man cannot make one hair
        white or black. Centuries rolled away. The Roman Empire tottered to
        its fall, and floods of vice and sorrow overspread the world; but
        still the denunciations of the Fathers were unabated. St. Ambrose,
        St. Jerome, and St. Gregory Nazianzen continued with uncompromising
        vehemence the war against false hair, which Tertullian and Clement of
        Alexandria had begun.<a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But although the
        vehemence of the Fathers on such trivial matters might appear at
        first sight to imply the existence of a society in which grave
        corruption was rare, such a conclusion would be totally untrue. After
        every legitimate allowance has been made, the pictures of Roman
        society by Ammianus Marcellinus, of the society of Marseilles, by
        Salvian, of the society of Asia Minor, and of Constantinople, by
        Chrysostom, as well as the whole tenor of the history, and

        corruption had reached classes and institutions that appeared the
        most holy. The Agapæ, or love feasts, which formed one of the most
        touching symbols of Christian unity, had become scenes of drunkenness
        and of riot. Denounced by the Fathers, condemned by the Council of
        Laodicea in the fourth century, and afterwards by the Council of
        Carthage, they lingered as a scandal and an offence till they were
        finally suppressed by the Council of Trullo, at the end of the
        seventh century.<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href=

        commemoration of the martyrs soon degenerated into scandalous
        dissipation. Fairs were held on the occasion, gross breaches of

        the pilgrimages of their fellow-countrywomen; for there were few
        towns in central Europe, on the way to Rome, where English ladies,
        who started as pilgrims, were not living in open prostitution.<a id=

        bitterly acknowledged. St. Jerome complained that the banquets of
        many bishops eclipsed in splendour those of the provincial governors,
        and the intrigues by which they obtained offices, and the fierce
        partisanship of their supporters, appear in every page of
        ecclesiastical history.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the lay world,
        perhaps the chief characteristic was extreme childishness. The moral
        enthusiasm was greater than it had been in most periods of Paganism,
        but, being drawn away to the desert, it had little influence upon
        society. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg
        153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        simple fact that the quarrels between the factions of the chariot
        races for a long period eclipsed all political, intellectual, and
        even religious differences, filled the streets again and again with
        bloodshed, and more than once determined great revolutions in the
        State, is sufficient to show the extent of the decadence. Patriotism
        and courage had almost disappeared, and, notwithstanding the rise of
        a Belisarius or a Narses, the level of public men was extremely
        depressed. The luxury of the court, the servility of the courtiers,
        and the prevailing splendour of dress and of ornament, had attained
        an extravagant height. The world grew accustomed to a dangerous
        alternation of extreme asceticism and gross vice, and sometimes, as
        in the case of Antioch,<a id="noteref_339" name="noteref_339" href=
        "#note_339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">339</span></span></a> the
        most vicious and luxurious cities produced the most numerous
        anchorites. There existed a combination of vice and superstition
        which is eminently prejudicial to the nobility, though not equally
        detrimental to the happiness, of man. Public opinion was so low, that
        very many forms of vice attracted little condemnation and punishment,
        while undoubted belief in the absolving efficacy of superstitious
        rites calmed the imagination and allayed the terrors of conscience.
        There was more falsehood and treachery than under the Cæsars, but
        there was much less cruelty, violence, and shamelessness. There was
        also less public spirit, less independence of character, less
        intellectual freedom.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In some respects,
        however, Christianity had already effected a great improvement. The
        gladiatorial games had disappeared from the West, and had not been
        introduced into Constantinople. The vast schools of prostitution
        which had grown up under the name of temples of Venus were
        suppressed. Religion, however deformed and debased, was at least no
        longer a seedplot of depravity, and under the influence of
        Christianity the effrontery of vice had in a great <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> measure disappeared. The gross and
        extravagant indecency of representation, of which we have still
        examples in the paintings on the walls, and the signs on many of the
        portals of Pompeii; the banquets of rich patricians, served by naked
        girls; the hideous excesses of unnatural lust, in which some of the
        Pagan emperors had indulged with so much publicity, were no longer
        tolerated. Although sensuality was very general, it was less
        obtrusive, and unnatural and eccentric forms had become rare. The
        presence of a great Church, which, amid much superstition and
        fanaticism, still taught a pure morality, and enforced it by the
        strongest motives, was everywhere felt—controlling, strengthening, or
        overawing. The ecclesiastics were a great body in the State. The
        cause of virtue was strongly organised; it drew to itself the best
        men, determined the course of vacillating but amiable natures, and
        placed some restraint upon the vicious. A bad man might be insensible
        to the moral beauties of religion, but he was still haunted by the
        recollection of its threatenings. If he emancipated himself from its
        influence in health and prosperity, its power returned in periods of
        sickness or danger, or on the eve of the commission of some great
        crime. If he had nerved himself against all its terrors, he was at
        least checked and governed at every turn by the public opinion which
        it had created. That total absence of all restraint, all decency, and
        all fear and remorse, which had been evinced by some of the monsters
        of crime who occupied the Pagan throne, and which proves most
        strikingly the decay of the Pagan religion, was no longer possible.
        The virtue of the best Pagans was perhaps of as high an order as that
        of the best Christians, though it was of a somewhat different type,
        but the vice of the worst Pagans certainly far exceeded that of the
        worst Christians. The pulpit had become a powerful centre of
        attraction, and charities of many kinds were actively developed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moral effects
        of the first great outburst of asceticism, <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> so far as we have yet traced them, appear
        almost unmingled evils. In addition to the essentially distorted
        ideal of perfection it produced, the simple withdrawal from active
        life of that moral enthusiasm, which is the leaven of society, was
        extremely pernicious, and there can be little doubt that to this
        cause we must in a great degree attribute the conspicuous failure of
        the Church, for some centuries, to effect any more considerable
        amelioration in the moral condition of Europe. There were, however,
        some distinctive excellences springing even from the first phase of
        asceticism, which, although they do not, as I conceive, suffice to
        counterbalance these evils, may justly qualify our censure.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
        condition of all really great moral excellence is a spirit of genuine
        self-sacrifice and self-renunciation. The habits of compromise,
        moderation, reciprocal self-restraint, gentleness, courtesy, and
        refinement, which are appropriate to luxurious or utilitarian
        civilisations, are very favourable to the development of many
        secondary virtues; but there is in human nature a capacity for a
        higher and more heroic reach of excellence, which demands very
        different spheres for its display, accustoms men to far nobler aims,
        and exercises a far greater attractive influence upon mankind.
        Imperfect and distorted as was the ideal of the anchorite; deeply,
        too, as it was perverted by the admixture of a spiritual selfishness,
        still the example of many thousands, who, in obedience to what they
        believed to be right, voluntarily gave up everything that men hold
        dear, cast to the winds every compromise with enjoyment, and made
        extreme self-abnegation the very principle of their lives, was not
        wholly lost upon the world. At a time when increasing riches had
        profoundly tainted the Church, they taught men <span class=

        they systematically abstained from them, teaching, in their quaint
        but energetic language, that <span class="tei tei-q">“there are two

        very eccentricities of their lives, their uncouth forms, their
        horrible penances, won the admiration of rude men, and the
        superstitious reverence thus excited gradually passed to the charity
        and the self-denial which formed the higher elements of the monastic
        character. Multitudes of barbarians were converted to Christianity at
        the sight of St. Simeon Stylites. The hermit, too, was speedily
        idealised by the popular imagination. The more repulsive features of
        his life and appearance were forgotten. He was thought of only as an
        old man with long white beard and gentle aspect, weaving his mats
        beneath the palm-trees, while dæmons vainly tried to distract him by
        their stratagems, and the wild beasts grew tame in his presence, and
        every disease and every sorrow vanished at his word. The imagination
        of Christendom, fascinated by this ideal, made it the centre of
        countless legends, usually very childish, and occasionally, as we
        have seen, worse than childish, yet full of beautiful touches of
        human nature, and often conveying admirable moral lessons.<a id=

        tales, which first determine the course of the infant imagination,
        play no inconsiderable part in the history of humanity. In the fable
        of Psyche—that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg
        157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        bright tale of passionate love with which the Greek mother lulled her
        child to rest—Pagan antiquity has bequeathed us a single specimen of
        transcendent beauty, and the lives of the saints of the desert often
        exhibit an imagination different indeed in kind, but scarcely less
        brilliant in its display. St. Antony, we are told, was thinking one
        night that he was the best man in the desert, when it was revealed to
        him that there was another hermit far holier than himself. In the
        morning he started across the desert to visit this unknown saint. He
        met first of all a centaur, and afterwards a little man with horns
        and goat's feet, who said that he was a faun; and these, having
        pointed out the way, he arrived at last at his destination. St. Paul
        the hermit, at whose cell he stopped, was one hundred and thirteen
        years old, and, having been living for a very long period in absolute
        solitude, he at first refused to admit the visitor, but at last
        consented, embraced him, and began, with a very pardonable curiosity,
        to question him minutely about the world he had left; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“whether there was much new building in the towns, what
        empire ruled the world, whether there were any idolaters
        remaining?”</span> The colloquy was interrupted by a crow, which came
        with a loaf of bread, and St. Paul, observing that during the last
        sixty years his daily allowance had been only half a loaf, declared
        that this was a proof that he had done right in admitting Antony. The
        hermits returned thanks, and sat down together by the margin of a
        glassy stream. But now a difficulty arose. Neither could bring
        himself to break the loaf before the other. St. Paul alleged that St.
        Antony, being his guest, should take the precedence; but St. Antony,
        who was only ninety years old, dwelt upon the greater age of St.
        Paul. So scrupulously polite were these old men, that they passed the
        entire afternoon disputing on this weighty question, till at last,
        when the evening was drawing in, a happy thought struck them, and,
        each holding one end of the loaf, they pulled together. To abridge
        the story, St. Paul soon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg
        158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        died, and his companion, being a weak old man, was unable to bury
        him, when two lions came from the desert and dug the grave with their
        paws, deposited the body in it, raised a loud howl of lamentation,
        and then knelt down submissively before St. Antony, to beg a
        blessing. The authority for this history is no less a person than St.
        Jerome, who relates it as literally true, and intersperses his
        narrative with severe reflections on all who might question his
        accuracy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The historian
        Palladius assures us that he heard from the lips of St. Macarius of
        Alexandria an account of a pilgrimage which that saint had made,
        under the impulse of curiosity, to visit the enchanted garden of
        Jannes and Jambres, tenanted by dæmons. For nine days Macarius
        traversed the desert, directing his course by the stars, and, from
        time to time, fixing reeds in the ground, as landmarks for his
        return; but this precaution proved useless, for the devils tore up
        the reeds, and placed them during the night by the head of the
        sleeping saint. As he drew near the garden, seventy dæmons of various
        forms came forth to meet him, and reproached him for disturbing them
        in their home. St. Macarius promised simply to walk round and inspect
        the wonders of the garden, and then depart without doing it any
        injury. He fulfilled his promise, and a journey of twenty days
        brought him again to his cell.<a id="noteref_343" name="noteref_343"

        legends are, however, of a less fantastic nature; and many of them
        display, though sometimes in very whimsical forms, a spirit of
        courtesy which seems to foreshadow the later chivalry, and some of
        them contain striking protests against the very superstitions that
        were most prevalent. When St. Macarius was sick, a bunch of grapes
        was once given to him; but his charity impelled him to give them to
        another hermit, who in his turn refused to keep them, and at last,
        having made the circuit of the entire desert, they were returned to
        the saint.<a id="noteref_344" name="noteref_344" href=

        water for as many days as he had drunk glasses of wine.<a id=

        dæmon?”</span> The priest, naturally indignant, beat the Christian
        severely, and was proceeding on his way, when he met St. Macarius,
        who accosted him so courteously and so tenderly that the Pagan's
        heart was touched, he became a convert, and his first act of charity
        was to tend the Christian whom he had beaten.<a id="noteref_346"

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Alas! I am filled with anguish that you have

        saint immediately visited them, and asked their mode of life, but
        they utterly repudiated the notion of their sanctity. <span class=

        good works, then, can you expect from us?”</span> The saint, however,
        persisted in his inquiries, and they then told him their stories.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“We are,”</span> they said, <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have multiplied
        these illustrations to an extent that must, I fear, have already
        somewhat taxed the patience of my readers; but the fact that, during
        a long period of history, these saintly legends formed the ideals
        guiding the imagination <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg

        reflecting the moral sentiment of the Christian world, gives them an
        importance far beyond their intrinsic value. Before dismissing the
        saints of the desert, there is one other class of legends to which I
        desire to advert. I mean those which describe the connection between
        saints and the animal world. These legends are, I think, worthy of
        special notice in moral history, as representing the first, and at
        the same time one of the most striking efforts ever made in
        Christendom to inculcate a feeling of kindness and pity towards the
        brute creation. In Pagan antiquity, considerable steps had been made
        to raise this form of humanity to a recognised branch of ethics. The
        way had been prepared by numerous anecdotes growing for the most part
        out of simple ignorance of natural history, which all tended to
        diminish the chasm between men and animals, by representing the
        latter as possessing to a very high degree both moral and rational
        qualities. Elephants, it was believed, were endowed not only with
        reason and benevolence, but also with reverential feelings. They
        worshipped the sun and moon, and in the forests of Mauritania they
        were accustomed to assemble every new moon, at a certain river, to
        perform religious rites.<a id="noteref_351" name="noteref_351" href=

        traces from an early period of a certain measure of legislative
        protection for animals. By a very natural process, the ox, as a
        principal agent in agriculture, and therefore a kind of symbol of
        civilisation, was in many different countries regarded with a
        peculiar reverence. The sanctity attached to it in Egypt is well
        known. That tenderness to animals, which is one of the most beautiful
        features in the Old Testament writings, shows itself, among other

        sensitiveness to the feelings of the animal world. This tender
        interest in animal life is one of the most distinctive features of
        the poetry of Virgil. Lucretius, who rarely struck the chords of
        pathos, had at a still earlier period drawn a very beautiful picture
        of the sorrows of the bereaved cow, whose calf had been sacrificed
        upon the altar.<a id="noteref_366" name="noteref_366" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These touches of
        feeling, slight as they may appear, indicate, I think, a vein of
        sentiment such as we should scarcely have expected to find coexisting
        with the gigantic slaughter of the amphitheatre. The progress,
        however, was not only one of sentiment—it was also shown in distinct
        and definite teaching. Pythagoras and Empedocles were quoted as the
        founders of this branch of ethics. The moral duty of kindness to
        animals was in the first instance based upon a dogmatic assertion of
        the transmigration of souls, and, the doctrine that animals are
        within the circle of human duty being thus laid down, subsidiary
        considerations of humanity were alleged. The rapid growth of the
        Pythagorean school, in the latter days of the Empire, made these
        considerations familiar to the people.<a id="noteref_372" name=

        Porphyry elaborately advocated, and even Seneca for a time practised,
        abstinence from flesh. But the most remarkable figure in this
        movement is unquestionably Plutarch. Casting aside the dogma of
        transmigration, or at least speaking of it only as a doubtful
        conjecture, he places the duty of kindness to animals on the broad
        ground of the affections, and he urges that duty with an emphasis and
        a detail to which no adequate parallel can, I believe, be found in
        the Christian writings for at least seventeen hundred years. He
        condemns absolutely the games of the amphitheatre, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dwells with great force upon the effect
        of such spectacles in hardening the character, enumerates in detail,
        and denounces with unqualified energy, the refined cruelties which
        gastronomic fancies had produced, and asserts in the strongest
        language that every man has duties to the animal world as truly as to
        his fellow-men.<a id="noteref_373" name="noteref_373" href=
        "#note_373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we now pass to
        the Christian Church, we shall find that little or no progress was at
        first made in this sphere. Among the Manicheans, it is true, the
        mixture of Oriental notions was shown in an absolute prohibition of
        animal food, and abstinence from this food was also frequently
        practised upon totally different grounds by the orthodox. One or two
        of the Fathers have also mentioned with approbation the humane
        counsels of the Pythagoreans.<a id="noteref_374" name="noteref_374"
        href="#note_374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">374</span></span></a> But, on
        the other hand, the doctrine of transmigration was emphatically
        repudiated by the Catholics; the human race was isolated, by the
        scheme of redemption, more than ever from all other races; and in the
        range and circle of duties inculcated by the early Fathers those to
        animals had no place. This is indeed the one form of humanity which
        appears more prominently in the Old Testament than in the New. The
        many beautiful traces of it in the former, which indicate a
        sentiment,<a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375" href=
        "#note_375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a> even
        where they do not very strictly define a duty, gave way before an
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168"
        id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ardent philanthropy which
        regarded human interests as the one end, and the relations of man to
        his Creator as the one question, of life, and dismissed somewhat
        contemptuously, as an idle sentimentalism, notions of duty to
        animals.<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href=
        "#note_376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a> A
        refined and subtle sympathy with animal feeling is indeed rarely
        found among those who are engaged very actively in the affairs of
        life, and it was not without a meaning or a reason that Shakespeare
        placed that exquisitely pathetic analysis of the sufferings of the
        wounded stag, which is perhaps its most perfect poetical expression,
        in the midst of the morbid dreamings of the diseased and melancholy
        Jacques.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while what are
        called the rights of animals had no place in the ethics of the
        Church, a feeling of sympathy with the irrational creation was in
        some degree inculcated indirectly by the incidents of the hagiology.
        It was very natural that the hermit, living in the lonely deserts of
        the East, or in the vast forests of Europe, should come into an
        intimate connection with the animal world, and it was no less natural
        that the popular imagination, when depicting the hermit life, should
        make this connection the centre of many picturesque and sometimes
        touching legends. The birds, it was said, stooped in their flight at
        the old man's call; the lion and the hyena crouched submissively at
        his feet; his heart, which was closed to all human interests,
        expanded freely at the sight of some suffering animal; and something
        of his own sanctity descended to the companions of his solitude and
        the objects of his miracles. The wild beasts attended St. Theon when
        he walked abroad, and the saint rewarded them by giving them drink
        out of his well. An Egyptian hermit had made a beautiful garden in
        the desert, and used to sit beneath the palm-trees while a lion ate
        fruit from his hand. When <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg
        169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> St.
        Pœmen was shivering in a winter night, a lion crouched beside him,
        and became his covering. Lions buried St. Paul the hermit and St.
        Mary of Egypt. They appear in the legends of St. Jerome, St.
        Gerasimus, St. John the Silent, St. Simeon, and many others. When an
        old and feeble monk, named Zosimas, was on his journey to Cæsarea,
        with an ass which bore his possessions, a lion seized and devoured
        the ass, but, at the command of the saint, the lion itself carried
        the burden to the city gates. St. Helenus called a wild ass from its
        herd to bear his burden through the wilderness. The same saint, as
        well as St. Pachomius, crossed the Nile on the back of a crocodile,
        as St. Scuthinus did the Irish Channel on a sea monster. Stags
        continually accompanied saints upon their journeys, bore their
        burdens, ploughed their fields, revealed their relics. The hunted
        stag was especially the theme of many picturesque legends. A Pagan,
        named Branchion, was once pursuing an exhausted stag, when it took
        refuge in a cavern, whose threshold no inducement could persuade the
        hounds to cross. The astonished hunter entered, and found himself in
        presence of an old hermit, who at once protected the fugitive and
        converted the pursuer. In the legends of St. Eustachius and St.
        Hubert, Christ is represented as having assumed the form of a hunted
        stag, which turned upon its pursuer, with a crucifix glittering on
        its brow, and, addressing him with a human voice, converted him to
        Christianity. In the full frenzy of a chase, hounds and stag stopped
        and knelt down together to venerate the relics of St. Fingar. On the
        festival of St. Regulus, the wild stags assembled at the tomb of the
        saint, as the ravens used to do at that of St. Apollinar of Ravenna.
        St. Erasmus was the special protector of oxen, and they knelt down
        voluntarily before his shrine. St. Antony was the protector of hogs,
        who were usually introduced into his pictures. St. Bridget kept pigs,
        and a wild boar came from the forest to subject itself to her rule. A
        horse foreshadowed by its lamentations the death of St. Columba. The
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170"
        id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> three companions of St. Colman
        were a cock, a mouse, and a fly. The cock announced the hour of
        devotion, the mouse bit the ear of the drowsy saint till he got up,
        and if in the course of his studies he was afflicted by any wandering
        thoughts, or called away to other business, the fly alighted on the
        line where he had left off, and kept the place. Legends, not without
        a certain whimsical beauty, described the moral qualities existing in
        animals. A hermit was accustomed to share his supper with a wolf,
        which, one evening entering the cell before the return of the master,
        stole a loaf of bread. Struck with remorse, it was a week before it
        ventured again to visit the cell, and when it did so, its head hung
        down, and its whole demeanour manifested the most profound
        contrition. The hermit <span class="tei tei-q">“stroked with a gentle
        hand its bowed down head,”</span> and gave it a double portion as a
        token of forgiveness. A lioness knelt down with lamentations before
        another saint, and then led him to its cub, which was blind, but
        which received its sight at the prayer of the saint. Next day the
        lioness returned, bearing the skin of a wild beast as a mark of its
        gratitude. Nearly the same thing happened to St. Macarius of
        Alexandria; a hyena knocked at his door, brought its young, which was
        blind, and which the saint restored to sight, and repaid the
        obligation soon afterwards by bringing a fleece of wool. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“O hyena!”</span> said the saint, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“how did you obtain this fleece? you must have stolen and
        eaten a sheep.”</span> Full of shame, the hyena hung its head down,
        but persisted in offering its gift, which, however, the holy man
        refused to receive till the hyena <span class="tei tei-q">“had
        sworn”</span> to cease for the future to rob. The hyena bowed its
        head in token of its acceptance of the oath, and St. Macarius
        afterwards gave the fleece to St. Melania. Other legends simply speak
        of the sympathy between saints and the irrational world. The birds
        came at the call of St. Cuthbert, and a dead bird was resuscitated by
        his prayer. When St. Aengussius, in felling wood, had cut his hand,
        the birds gathered round, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg
        171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        with loud cries lamented his misfortune. A little bird, struck down
        and mortally wounded by a hawk, fell at the feet of St. Kieranus, who
        shed tears as he looked upon its torn breast, and offered up a
        prayer, upon which the bird was instantly healed.<a id="noteref_377"
        name="noteref_377" href="#note_377"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">377</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many hundreds, I
        should perhaps hardly exaggerate were I to say many thousands, of
        legends of this kind exist in the lives of the saints. Suggested in
        the first instance by that desert life which was at once the earliest
        phase of monachism and one of the earliest sources of Christian
        mythology, strengthened by the symbolism which represented different
        virtues and vices under the forms of animals, and by the
        reminiscences of the rites and the superstitions of Paganism, the
        connection between men and animals became the keynote of an infinite
        variety of fantastic tales. In our eyes they may appear extravagantly
        puerile, yet it will scarcely, I hope, be necessary to apologise for
        introducing them into what purports to be a grave work, when it is
        remembered that for many centuries they were universally accepted by
        mankind, and were so interwoven with all local traditions, and with
        all the associations of education, that they at once determined and
        reflected the inmost feelings of the heart. Their tendency to create
        a certain feeling of sympathy towards animals is manifest, and this
        is probably the utmost <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg
        172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        Catholic Church has done in that direction.<a id="noteref_378" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">378</span></span></a> A very
        few authentic instances may, indeed, be cited of saints whose natural
        gentleness of disposition was displayed in kindness to the animal
        world. Of St. James of Venice—an obscure saint of the thirteenth
        century—it is told that he was accustomed to buy and release the
        birds with which Italian boys used to play by attaching them to
        strings, saying that <span class="tei tei-q">“he pitied the little
        birds of the Lord,”</span> and that his <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“tender charity recoiled from all cruelty, even to the
        most diminutive of animals.”</span><a id="noteref_379" name=
        "noteref_379" href="#note_379"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a> St.
        Francis of Assisi was a more conspicuous example of the same spirit.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“If I could only be presented to the
        emperor,”</span> he used to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I would
        pray him, for the love of God, and of me, to issue an edict
        prohibiting any one from catching or imprisoning my sisters the
        larks, and ordering that all who have oxen or asses should at
        Christmas feed them particularly well.”</span> A crowd of legends
        turning upon this theme were related of him. A wolf, near Gubbio,
        being adjured by him, promised to abstain from eating sheep, placed
        its paw in the hand of the saint to ratify the promise, and was
        afterwards fed from house to house by the inhabitants of the city. A
        crowd of birds, on another occasion, came to hear the saint preach,
        as fish did to hear St. Antony of Padua. A falcon awoke him at his
        hour of prayer. A grasshopper encouraged him by her melody to sing
        praises to God. The noisy swallows kept silence when he began to
        teach.<a id="noteref_380" name="noteref_380" href=
        "#note_380"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the whole,
        however, Catholicism has done very little to inculcate humanity to
        animals. The fatal vice of theologians, who have always looked upon
        others solely through the medium of their own special dogmatic views,
        has been an obstacle to all advance in this direction. The animal
        world, being altogether external to the scheme of redemption, was
        regarded as beyond the range of duty, and the belief that we have any
        kind of obligation to its members has never been inculcated—has
        never, I believe, been even admitted—by Catholic theologians. In the
        popular legends, and in the recorded traits of individual amiability,
        it is curious to observe how constantly those who have sought to
        inculcate kindness to animals have done so by endeavouring to
        associate them with something distinctively Christian. The legends I
        have noticed glorified them as the companions of the saints. The stag
        was honoured as especially commissioned to reveal the relics of
        saints, and as the deadly enemy of the serpent. In the feast of
        asses, that animal was led with veneration into the churches, and a
        rude hymn proclaimed its dignity, because it had borne Christ in His
        flight to Egypt, and in His entry into Jerusalem. St. Francis always
        treated lambs with a peculiar tenderness, as being symbols of his
        Master. Luther grew sad and thoughtful at a hare hunt, for it seemed
        to him to represent the pursuit of souls by the devil. Many popular
        legends exist, associating some bird or animal with some incident in
        the evangelical narrative, and securing for them in consequence an
        unmolested life. But such influences have never extended far. There
        are two distinct objects which may be considered by moralists in this
        sphere. They may regard the character of the men, or they may regard
        the sufferings of the animals. The amount of callousness or of
        conscious cruelty displayed or elicited by amusements or practices
        that inflict suffering on animals, bears no kind of proportion to the
        intensity of that suffering. Could we follow with adequate
        realisation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg
        174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        pangs of the wounded birds that are struck down in our sports, or of
        the timid hare in the long course of its flight, we should probably
        conclude that they were not really less than those caused by the
        Spanish bull-fight, or by the English pastimes of the last century.
        But the excitement of the chase refracts the imagination, and owing
        to the diminutive size of the victim, and the undemonstrative
        character of its suffering, these sports do not exercise that
        prejudicial influence upon character which they would exercise if the
        sufferings of the animals were vividly realised, and were at the same
        time accepted as an element of the enjoyment. The class of amusements
        of which the ancient combats of wild beasts form the type, have no
        doubt nearly disappeared from Christendom, and it is possible that
        the softening power of Christian teaching may have had some indirect
        influence in abolishing them; but a candid judgment will confess that
        it has been very little. During the periods, and in the countries, in
        which theological influence was supreme, they were
        unchallenged.<a id="noteref_381" name="noteref_381" href=

        countries the clergy have, on the whole, sustained this movement. In
        Catholic countries it has been much more faithfully represented by
        the school of Voltaire and Beccaria. A judicious moralist may,
        however, reasonably question whether amusements which derive their
        zest from a display of the natural ferocious instincts of animals,
        and which substitute death endured in the frenzy of combat for death
        in the remote slaughter-house or by the slow process of decay, have
        added in any appreciable degree to the sum of animal misery, and in
        these cases he will dwell less upon the suffering inflicted than upon
        the injurious influence the spectacle may sometimes exercise on the
        character of the spectator. But there are forms of cruelty which must
        be regarded in a different light. The horrors of vivisection, often
        so wantonly, so needlessly practised,<a id="noteref_384" name=
        "noteref_384" href="#note_384"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a> the
        prolonged and atrocious tortures, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> sometimes inflicted in order to procure some
        gastronomic delicacy, are so far removed from the public gaze that
        they exercise little influence on the character of men. Yet no humane
        man can reflect upon them without a shudder. To bring these things
        within the range of ethics, to create the notion of duties towards
        the animal world, has, so far as Christian countries are concerned,
        been one of the peculiar merits of the last century, and, for the
        most part, of Protestant nations. However fully we may recognise the
        humane spirit transmitted to the world in the form of legends from
        the saints of the desert, it must not be forgotten that the
        inculcation of humanity to animals on a wide scale is mainly the work
        of a recent and a secular age; that the Mohammedans and the Brahmins
        have in this sphere considerably surpassed the Christians, and that
        Spain and Southern Italy, in which Catholicism has most deeply
        planted its roots, are even now, probably beyond all other countries
        in Europe, those in which inhumanity to animals is most wanton and
        most unrebuked.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The influence the
        first form of monachism has exercised upon the world, so far as it
        has been beneficial, has been chiefly through the imagination, which
        has been fascinated by its legends. In the great periods of
        theological controversy, the Eastern monks had furnished some leading
        theologians; but in general, in Oriental lands, the hermit life
        predominated, and extreme maceration was the chief merit of the
        saint. But in the West, monachism assumed very different forms, and
        exercised far higher functions. At first the Oriental saints were the
        ideals of Western monks. The Eastern St. Athanasius had been the
        founder of Italian monachism. St. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Martin of Tours excluded labour from the
        discipline of his monks, and he and they, like the Eastern saints,
        were accustomed to wander abroad, destroying the idols of the
        temples.<a id="noteref_385" name="noteref_385" href=
        "#note_385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a> But
        three great causes conspired to direct the monastic spirit in the
        West into practical channels. Conditions of race and climate have
        ever impelled the inhabitants of these lands to active life, and have
        at the same time rendered them constitutionally incapable of enduring
        the austerities or enjoying the hallucinations of the sedentary
        Oriental. There arose, too, in the sixth century, a great legislator,
        whose form may be dimly traced through a cloud of fantastic legends,
        and the order of St. Benedict, with that of St. Columba and some
        others, founded on substantially the same principle, soon ramified
        through the greater part of Europe, tempered the wild excesses of
        useless penances, and, making labour an essential part of the
        monastic system, directed the movement to the purposes of general
        civilisation. In the last place, the barbarian invasions, and the
        dissolution of the Western Empire, dislocating the whole system of
        government and almost resolving society into its primitive elements,
        naturally threw upon the monastic corporations social, political, and
        intellectual functions of the deepest importance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
        observed that the capture of Rome by Alaric, involving as it did the
        destruction of the grandest religious monuments of Paganism, in fact
        established in that city the supreme authority of Christianity.<a id=
        "noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href="#note_386"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a> A
        similar remark may be extended to the general downfall of the Western
        civilisation. In that civilisation Christianity had indeed been
        legally enthroned; but the philosophies and traditions of Paganism,
        and the ingrained habits of an ancient, and at the same time an
        effete society, continually paralysed its energies. What Europe would
        have been without the barbarian invasions, we may partly divine from
        the history of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg
        179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        Lower Empire, which represented, in fact, the old Roman civilisation
        prolonged and Christianised. The barbarian conquests, breaking up the
        old organisation, provided the Church with a virgin soil, and made
        it, for a long period, the supreme and indeed sole centre of
        civilisation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be
        difficult to exaggerate the skill and courage displayed by the
        ecclesiastics in this most trying period. We have already seen the
        noble daring with which they interfered between the conqueror and the
        vanquished, and the unwearied charity with which they sought to
        alleviate the unparalleled sufferings of Italy, when the colonial
        supplies of corn were cut off, and when the fairest plains were
        desolated by the barbarians. Still more wonderful is the rapid
        conversion of the barbarian tribes. Unfortunately this, which is one
        of the most important, is also one of the most obscure pages in the
        history of the Church. Of whole tribes or nations it may be truly
        said that we are absolutely ignorant of the cause of their change.
        The Goths had already been converted by Ulphilas, before the downfall
        of the Empire, and the conversion of the Germans and of several
        northern nations was long posterior to it; but the great work of
        Christianising the barbarian world was accomplished almost in the
        hour when that world became supreme. Rude tribes, accustomed in their
        own lands to pay absolute obedience to their priests, found
        themselves in a foreign country, confronted by a priesthood far more
        civilised and imposing than that which they had left, by gorgeous
        ceremonies, well fitted to entice, and by threats of coming judgment,
        well fitted to scare their imaginations. Disconnected from all their
        old associations, they bowed before the majesty of civilisation, and
        the Latin religion, like the Latin language, though with many
        adulterations, reigned over the new society. The doctrine of
        exclusive salvation, and the doctrine of dæmons, had an admirable
        missionary power. The first produced an ardour of proselytising which
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name=
        "Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> polytheist could never
        rival; while the Pagan, who was easily led to recognise the Christian
        God, was menaced with eternal fire if he did not take the further
        step of breaking off from his old divinities. The second dispensed
        the convert from the perhaps impossible task of disbelieving his
        former religion, for it was only necessary for him to degrade it,
        attributing its prodigies to infernal beings. The priests, in
        addition to their noble devotion, carried into their missionary
        efforts the most masterly judgment. The barbarian tribes usually
        followed without enquiry the religion of their sovereign; and it was
        to the conversion of the king, and still more to the conversion of
        the queen, that the Christians devoted all their energies. Clotilda,
        the wife of Clovis, Bertha, the wife of Ethelbert, and Theodolinda,
        the wife of Lothaire, were the chief instruments in converting their
        husbands and their nations. Nothing that could affect the imagination
        was neglected. It is related of Clotilda, that she was careful to
        attract her husband by the rich draperies of the ecclesiastical
        ceremonies.<a id="noteref_387" name="noteref_387" href=
        "#note_387"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">387</span></span></a> In
        another case, the first work of proselytising was confided to an
        artist, who painted before the terrified Pagans the last judgment and
        the torments of hell.<a id="noteref_388" name="noteref_388" href=
        "#note_388"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">388</span></span></a> But
        especially the belief, which was sincerely held, and sedulously
        inculcated, that temporal success followed in the train of
        Christianity, and that every pestilence, famine, or military disaster
        was the penalty of idolatry, heresy, sacrilege, or vice, assisted the
        movement. The theory was so wide, that it met every variety of
        fortune, and being taught with consummate skill, to barbarians who
        were totally destitute of all critical power, and strongly
        predisposed to accept it, it proved extremely efficacious; and hope,
        fear, gratitude, and remorse drew multitudes into the Church.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181"
        id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The transition was softened by
        the substitution of Christian ceremonies and saints for the festivals
        and the divinities of the Pagans.<a id="noteref_389" name=
        "noteref_389" href="#note_389"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">389</span></span></a> Besides
        the professed missionaries, the Christian captives zealously diffused
        their faith among their Pagan masters. When the chieftain had been
        converted, and the army had followed his profession, an elaborate
        monastic and ecclesiastical organisation grew up to consolidate the
        conquest, and repressive laws soon crushed all opposition to the
        faith.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these ways the
        victory of Christianity over the barbarian world was achieved. But
        that victory, though very great, was less decisive than might appear.
        A religion which professed to be Christianity, and which contained
        many of the ingredients of pure Christianity, had risen into the
        ascendant, but it had undergone a profound modification through the
        struggle. Religions, as well as worshippers, had been baptised. The
        festivals, images, and names of saints had been substituted for those
        of the idols, and the habits of thought and feeling of the ancient
        faith reappeared in new forms and a new language. The tendency to a
        material, idolatrous, and polytheistic faith, which had long been
        encouraged by the monks, and which the heretics Jovinian,
        Vigilantius, and Aerius had vainly resisted, was fatally strengthened
        by the infusion of a barbarian element into the Church, by the
        general depression of intellect in Europe, and by the many
        accommodations that were made to facilitate conversion. Though
        apparently defeated and crushed, the old gods still retained, under a
        new faith, no small part of their influence over the world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this tendency
        the leaders of the Church made in general no resistance, though in
        another form they were <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg
        182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        deeply persuaded of the vitality of the old gods. Many curious and
        picturesque legends attest the popular belief that the old Roman and
        the old barbarian divinities, in their capacity of dæmons, were still
        waging an unrelenting war against the triumphant faith. A great Pope
        of the sixth century relates how a Jew, being once benighted on his
        journey, and finding no other shelter for the night, lay down to rest
        in an abandoned temple of Apollo. Shuddering at the loneliness of the
        building, and fearing the dæmons who were said to haunt it, he
        determined, though not a Christian, to protect himself by the sign of
        the cross, which he had often heard possessed a mighty power against
        spirits. To that sign he owed his safety. For at midnight the temple
        was filled with dark and threatening forms. The god Apollo was
        holding his court at his deserted shrine, and his attendant dæmons
        were recounting the temptations they had devised against the
        Christians.<a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href=
        "#note_390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a> A newly
        married Roman, when one day playing ball, took off his wedding-ring,
        which he found an impediment in the game, and he gaily put it on the
        finger of a statue of Venus, that was standing near. When he
        returned, the marble finger had bent so that it was impossible to
        withdraw the ring, and that night the goddess appeared to him in a
        dream, and told him that she was now his wedded wife, and that she
        would abide with him for ever.<a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391"

        of the Mountains were consulting <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The details of the
        rapid propagation of Western monachism have been amply treated by
        many historians, and the causes of its success are sufficiently
        manifest. Some of the reasons I have assigned for the first spread of
        asceticism continued to operate, while others of a still more
        powerful kind had arisen. The rapid decomposition of the entire Roman
        Empire by continuous invasions of barbarians rendered the existence
        of an inviolable asylum and centre of peaceful labour a matter of
        transcendent importance, and the monastery as organised by St.
        Benedict soon combined the most heterogeneous elements of attraction.
        It was at once eminently aristocratic and intensely democratic. The
        power and princely position of the abbot were coveted, and usually
        obtained, by members of the most illustrious families; while
        emancipated serfs, or peasants who had lost their all in the
        invasions, or were harassed by savage nobles, or had fled from
        military service, or desired to lead a more secure and easy life,
        found in the monastery an unfailing refuge. The institution exercised
        all the influence of great wealth, expended for the most part with
        great charity, while the monk himself was invested with the aureole
        of a sacred poverty. To ardent and philanthropic natures, the
        profession opened boundless vistas of missionary, charitable, and
        civilising activity. To the superstitious it was the plain road to
        heaven. To the ambitious it was the portal to bishoprics, and, after
        the monk St. Gregory, not unfrequently to the Popedom. To the
        studious it offered the only opportunity then existing in the world
        of seeing many books and passing a life of study. To the timid and
        retiring it afforded the most secure, and probably the least
        laborious life a poor peasant could hope to find. Vast as were the
        multitudes that thronged the monasteries, the means for their support
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184"
        id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> were never wanting. The belief
        that gifts or legacies to a monastery opened the doors of heaven was
        in a superstitious age sufficient to secure for the community an
        almost boundless wealth, which was still further increased by the
        skill and perseverance with which the monks tilled the waste lands,
        by the exemption of their domains from all taxation, and by the
        tranquillity which in the most turbulent ages they usually enjoyed.
        In France, the Low Countries, and Germany they were pre-eminently
        agriculturists. Gigantic forests were felled, inhospitable marshes
        reclaimed, barren plains cultivated by their hands. The monastery
        often became the nucleus of a city. It was the centre of civilisation
        and industry, the symbol of moral power in an age of turbulence and
        war.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must be
        observed, however, that the beneficial influence of the monastic
        system was necessarily transitional, and the subsequent corruption
        the normal and inevitable result of its constitution. Vast societies
        living in enforced celibacy, exercising an unbounded influence, and
        possessing enormous wealth, must necessarily have become hotbeds of
        corruption when the enthusiasm that had created them expired. The
        services they rendered as the centres of agriculture, the refuge of
        travellers, the sanctuaries in war, the counterpoise of the baronial
        castle, were no longer required when the convulsions of invasion had
        ceased and when civil society was definitely organised. And a similar
        observation may be extended even to their moral type. Thus, while it
        is undoubtedly true that the Benedictine monks, by making labour an
        essential element of their discipline, did very much to efface the
        stigma which slavery had affixed upon it, it is also true that, when
        industry had passed out of its initial stage, the monastic theories
        of the sanctity of poverty, and the evil of wealth, were its most
        deadly opponents. The dogmatic condemnation by theologians of loans
        at interest, which are the basis of industrial enterprise, was the
        expression of a far deeper antagonism of tendencies and
        ideals.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg
        185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In one important
        respect, the transition from the eremite to the monastic life
        involved not only a change of circumstances, but also a change of
        character. The habit of obedience, and the virtue of humility,
        assumed a position which they had never previously occupied. The
        conditions of the hermit life contributed to develop to a very high
        degree a spirit of independence and spiritual pride, which was still
        further increased by a curious habit that existed in the Church of
        regarding each eminent hermit as the special model or professor of
        some particular virtue, and making pilgrimages to him, in order to
        study this aspect of his character.<a id="noteref_393" name=
        "noteref_393" href="#note_393"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">393</span></span></a> These
        pilgrimages, combined with the usually solitary and self-sufficing
        life of the hermit, and also with the habit of measuring progress
        almost entirely by the suppression of a physical appetite, which it
        is quite possible wholly to destroy, very naturally produced an
        extreme arrogance.<a id="noteref_394" name="noteref_394" href=
        "#note_394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">394</span></span></a> But in
        the highly organised and disciplined monasteries of the West, passive
        obedience and humility were the very first things that were
        inculcated. The monastery, beyond all other institutions, was the
        school for their exercise; and as the monk represented the highest
        moral ideal of the age, obedience and humility acquired a new value
        in the minds of men. Nearly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg
        186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> all
        the feudal and other organisations that arose out of the chaos that
        followed the destruction of the Roman Empire were intimately related
        to the Church, not simply because the Church was the strongest power
        in Christendom, and supplied in itself an admirable model of an
        organised body, but also because it had done much to educate men in
        habits of obedience. The special value of this education depended
        upon the peculiar circumstances of the time. The ancient
        civilisations, and especially that of Rome, had been by no means
        deficient in those habits; but it was in the midst of the dissolution
        of an old society, and of the ascendancy of barbarians, who
        exaggerated to the highest degree their personal independence, that
        the Church proposed to the reverence of mankind a life of passive
        obedience as the highest ideal of virtue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The habit of
        obedience was no new thing in the world, but the disposition of
        humility was pre-eminently and almost exclusively a Christian virtue;
        and there has probably never been any sphere in which it has been so
        largely and so successfully inculcated as in the monastery. The whole
        penitential discipline, the entire mode or tenor of the monastic
        life, was designed to tame every sentiment of pride, and to give
        humility a foremost place in the hierarchy of virtues. We have here
        one great source of the mollifying influence of Catholicism. The
        gentler virtues—benevolence and amiability—may, and in an advanced
        civilisation often do, subsist in natures that are completely devoid
        of genuine humility; but, on the other hand, it is scarcely possible
        for a nature to be pervaded by a deep sentiment of humility without
        this sentiment exercising a softening influence over the whole
        character. To transform a fierce warlike nature into a character of a
        gentler type, the first essential is to awaken this feeling. In the
        monasteries, the extinction of social and domestic feelings, the
        narrow corporate spirit, and, still more, the atrocious opinions that
        were prevalent concerning the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> guilt of heresy, produced in many minds an
        extreme and most active ferocity; but the practice of charity, and
        the ideal of humility, never failed to exercise some softening
        influence upon Christendom.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, however
        advantageous the temporary pre-eminence of this moral type may have
        been, it was obviously unsuited for a later stage of civilisation.
        Political liberty is almost impossible where the monastic system is
        supreme, not merely because the monasteries divert the energies of
        the nation from civic to ecclesiastical channels, but also because
        the monastic ideal is the very apotheosis of servitude. Catholicism
        has been admirably fitted at once to mitigate and to perpetuate
        despotism. When men have learnt to reverence a life of passive,
        unreasoning obedience as the highest type of perfection, the
        enthusiasm and passion of freedom necessarily decline. In this
        respect there is an analogy between the monastic and the military
        spirit, both of which promote and glorify passive obedience, and
        therefore prepare the minds of men for despotic rule; but, on the
        whole, the monastic spirit is probably more hostile to freedom than
        the military spirit, for the obedience of the monk is based upon
        humility, while the obedience of the soldier coexists with pride.
        Now, a considerable measure of pride, or self-assertion, is an
        invariable characteristic of free communities.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ascendancy
        which the monastic system gave to the virtue of humility has not
        continued. This virtue is indeed the crowning grace and beauty of the
        most perfect characters of the saintly type; but experience has shown
        that among common men humility is more apt to degenerate into
        servility than pride into arrogance; and modern moralists have
        appealed more successfully to the sense of dignity than to the
        opposite feeling. Two of the most important steps of later moral
        history have consisted of the creation of a sentiment of pride as the
        parent and the guardian of many virtues. The first of these
        encroachments on the monastic <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> spirit was chivalry, which called into being a
        proud and jealous military honour that has never since been
        extinguished. The second was the creation of that feeling of
        self-respect which is one of the most remarkable characteristics that
        distinguish Protestant from the most Catholic populations, and which
        has proved among the former an invaluable moral agent, forming frank
        and independent natures, and checking every servile habit and all
        mean and degrading vice.<a id="noteref_395" name="noteref_395" href=
        "#note_395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">395</span></span></a> The
        peculiar vigour with which it has been developed in Protestant
        countries may be attributed to the suppression of monastic
        institutions and habits; to the stigma Protestantism has attached to
        mendicancy, which Catholicism has usually glorified and encouraged;
        to the high place Protestantism has accorded to private judgment and
        personal responsibility; and lastly, to the action of free political
        institutions, which have taken deepest root where the principles of
        the Reformation have been accepted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The relation of
        the monasteries to the intellectual virtues, which we have next to
        examine, opens out a wide field of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> discussion; and, in order to appreciate it, it
        will be necessary to revert briefly to a somewhat earlier stage of
        ecclesiastical history. And in the first place, it may be observed,
        that the phrase intellectual virtue, which is often used in a
        metaphorical sense, is susceptible of a strictly literal
        interpretation. If a sincere and active desire for truth be a moral
        duty, the discipline and the dispositions that are plainly involved
        in every honest search fall rigidly within the range of ethics. To
        love truth sincerely means to pursue it with an earnest,
        conscientious, unflagging zeal. It means to be prepared to follow the
        light of evidence even to the most unwelcome conclusions; to labour
        earnestly to emancipate the mind from early prejudices; to resist the
        current of the desires, and the refracting influence of the passions;
        to proportion on all occasions conviction to evidence, and to be
        ready, if need be, to exchange the calm of assurance for all the
        suffering of a perplexed and disturbed mind. To do this is very
        difficult and very painful; but it is clearly involved in the notion
        of earnest love of truth. If, then, any system stigmatises as
        criminal the state of doubt, denounces the examination of some one
        class of arguments or facts, seeks to introduce the bias of the
        affections into the enquiries of the reason, or regards the honest
        conclusion of an upright investigator as involving moral guilt, that
        system is subversive of intellectual honesty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
        ancients, although the methods of enquiry were often very faulty, and
        generalisations very hasty, a respect for the honest search after
        truth was widely diffused.<a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396"
        href="#note_396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">396</span></span></a> There
        were, as we have already seen, instances in which certain religious
        practices which were regarded as attestations of loyalty, or as
        necessary to propitiate the gods in favour of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the State, were enforced by law; there
        were even a few instances of philosophies, which were believed to
        lead directly to immoral results or social convulsions, being
        suppressed; but, as a general rule, speculation was untrammelled, the
        notion of there being any necessary guilt in erroneous opinion was
        unknown, and the boldest enquirers were regarded with honour and
        admiration. The religious theory of Paganism had in this respect some
        influence. Polytheism, with many faults, had three great merits. It
        was eminently poetical, eminently patriotic, and eminently tolerant.
        The conception of a vast hierarchy of beings more glorious than, but
        not wholly unlike, men, presiding over all the developments of
        nature, and filling the universe with their deeds, supplied the chief
        nutriment of the Greek imagination. The national religions,
        interweaving religious ceremonies and associations with all civic
        life, concentrated and intensified the sentiment of patriotism, and
        the notion of many distinct groups of gods led men to tolerate many
        forms of worship and great variety of creeds. In that colossal
        amalgam of nations of which Rome became the metropolis, intellectual
        liberty still further advanced; the vast variety of philosophies and
        beliefs expatiated unmolested; the search for truth was regarded as
        an important element of virtue, and the relentless and most sceptical
        criticism which Socrates had applied in turn to all the fundamental
        propositions of popular belief remained as an example to his
        successors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have already
        seen that one leading cause of the rapid progress of the Church was
        that its teachers enforced their distinctive tenets as absolutely
        essential to salvation, and thus assailed at a great advantage the
        supporters of all other creeds which did not claim this exclusive
        authority. We have seen, too, that in an age of great and growing
        credulity they had been conspicuous for their assertion of the duty
        of absolute, unqualified, and unquestioning belief. The notion of the
        guilt both of error and of doubt grew rapidly, and, being
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191"
        id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> soon regarded as a fundamental
        tenet, it determined the whole course and policy of the Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And here, I think,
        it will not be unadvisable to pause for a moment, and endeavour to
        ascertain what misconceived truth lay at the root of this fatal
        tenet. Considered abstractedly and by the light of nature, it is as
        unmeaning to speak of the immorality of an intellectual mistake as it
        would be to talk of the colour of a sound. If a man has sincerely
        persuaded himself that it is possible for parallel lines to meet, or
        for two straight lines to enclose a space, we pronounce his judgment
        to be absurd; but it is free from all tincture of immorality. And if,
        instead of failing to appreciate a demonstrable truth, his error
        consisted in a false estimate of the conflicting arguments of an
        historical problem, this mistake—assuming always that the enquiry was
        an upright one—is still simply external to the sphere of morals. It
        is possible that his conclusion, by weakening some barrier against
        vice, may produce vicious consequences, like those which might ensue
        from some ill-advised modification of the police force; but it in no
        degree follows from this that the judgment is in itself criminal. If
        a student applies himself with the same dispositions to Roman and
        Jewish histories, the mistakes he may make in the latter are no more
        immoral than those which he may make in the former.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are,
        however, two cases in which an intellectual error may be justly said
        to involve, or at least to represent, guilt. In the first place,
        error very frequently springs from the partial or complete absence of
        that mental disposition which is implied in a real love of truth.
        Hypocrites, or men who through interested motives profess opinions
        which they do not really believe, are probably rarer than is usually
        supposed; but it would be difficult to over-estimate the number of
        those whose genuine convictions are due to the unresisted bias of
        their interests. By the term interests, I mean not only material
        well-being, but also all those mental luxuries, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> all those grooves or channels for
        thought, which it is easy and pleasing to follow, and painful and
        difficult to abandon. Such are the love of ease, the love of
        certainty, the love of system, the bias of the passions, the
        associations of the imagination, as well as the coarser influences of
        social position, domestic happiness, professional interest, party
        feeling, or ambition. In most men, the love of truth is so languid,
        and the reluctance to encounter mental suffering is so great, that
        they yield their judgments without an effort to the current, withdraw
        their minds from all opinions or arguments opposed to their own, and
        thus speedily convince themselves of the truth of what they wish to
        believe. He who really loves truth is bound at least to endeavour to
        resist these distorting influences, and in as far as his opinions are
        the result of his not having done so, in so far they represent a
        moral failing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the next place,
        it must be observed that every moral disposition brings with it an
        intellectual bias which exercises a great and often a controlling and
        decisive influence even upon the most earnest enquirer. If we know
        the character or disposition of a man, we can usually predict with
        tolerable accuracy many of his opinions. We can tell to what side of
        politics, to what canons of taste, to what theory of morals he will
        naturally incline. Stern, heroic, and haughty natures tend to systems
        in which these qualities occupy the foremost position in the moral
        type, while gentle natures will as naturally lean towards systems in
        which the amiable virtues are supreme. Impelled by a species of moral
        gravitation, the enquirer will glide insensibly to the system which
        is congruous to his disposition, and intellectual difficulties will
        seldom arrest him. He can have observed human nature with but little
        fruit who has not remarked how constant is this connection, and how
        very rarely men change fundamentally the principles they had
        deliberately adopted on religious, moral, or even political
        questions, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg
        193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        without the change being preceded, accompanied, or very speedily
        followed, by a serious modification of character. So, too, a vicious
        and depraved nature, or a nature which is hard, narrow, and
        unsympathetic, will tend, much less by calculation or indolence than
        by natural affinity, to low and degrading views of human nature.
        Those who have never felt the higher emotions will scarcely
        appreciate them. The materials with which the intellect builds are
        often derived from the heart, and a moral disease is therefore not
        unfrequently at the root of an erroneous judgment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of these two
        truths the first cannot, I think, be said to have had any influence
        in the formation of the theological notion of the guilt of error. An
        elaborate process of mental discipline, with a view to strengthening
        the critical powers of the mind, is utterly remote from the spirit of
        theology; and this is one of the great reasons why the growth of an
        inductive and scientific spirit is invariably hostile to theological
        interests. To raise the requisite standard of proof, to inculcate
        hardness and slowness of belief, is the first task of the inductive
        reasoner. He looks with great favour upon the condition of a
        suspended judgment; he encourages men rather to prolong than to
        abridge it; he regards the tendency of the human mind to rapid and
        premature generalisations as one of its most fatal vices; he desires
        especially that that which is believed should not be so cherished
        that the mind should be indisposed to admit doubt, or, on the
        appearance of new arguments, to revise with impartiality its
        conclusions. Nearly all the greatest intellectual achievements of the
        last three centuries have been preceded and prepared by the growth of
        scepticism. The historic scepticism which Vico, Beaufort, Pouilly,
        and Voltaire in the last century, and Niebuhr and Lewis in the
        present century, applied to ancient history, lies at the root of all
        the great modern efforts to reconstruct the history of mankind. The
        splendid discoveries of physical science would have been impossible
        but for the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg
        194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        scientific scepticism of the school of Bacon, which dissipated the
        old theories of the universe, and led men to demand a severity of
        proof altogether unknown to the ancients. The philosophic scepticism
        with which the system of Hume ended and the system of Kant began, has
        given the greatest modern impulse to metaphysics and ethics. Exactly
        in proportion, therefore, as men are educated in the inductive
        school, they are alienated from those theological systems which
        represent a condition of doubt as sinful, seek to govern the reason
        by the interests and the affections, and make it a main object to
        destroy the impartiality of the judgment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But although it is
        difficult to look upon Catholicism in any other light than as the
        most deadly enemy of the scientific spirit, it has always cordially
        recognised the most important truth, that character in a very great
        measure determines opinions. To cultivate the moral type that is most
        congenial to the opinions it desires to recommend has always been its
        effort, and the conviction that a deviation from that type has often
        been the predisposing cause of intellectual heresy, had doubtless a
        large share in the first persuasion of the guilt of error. But
        priestly and other influences soon conspired to enlarge this
        doctrine. A crowd of speculative, historical, and administrative
        propositions were asserted as essential to salvation, and all who
        rejected them were wholly external to the bond of Christian
        sympathy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, indeed, we put
        aside the pure teaching of the Christian founders, and consider the
        actual history of the Church since Constantine, we shall find no
        justification for the popular theory that beneath its influence the
        narrow spirit of patriotism faded into a wide and cosmopolitan
        philanthropy. A real though somewhat languid feeling of universal
        brotherhood had already been created in the world by the universality
        of the Roman Empire. In the new faith the range of genuine sympathy
        was strictly limited by the creed. According to the popular belief,
        all who differed from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg
        195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        teaching of the orthodox lived under the hatred of the Almighty, and
        were destined after death for an eternity of anguish. Very naturally,
        therefore, they were wholly alienated from the true believers, and no
        moral or intellectual excellence could atone for their crime in
        propagating error. The eighty or ninety sects,<a id="noteref_397"

        which Christianity speedily divided, hated one another with an
        intensity that extorted the wonder of Julian and the ridicule of the
        Pagans of Alexandria, and the fierce riots and persecutions that
        hatred produced appear in every page of ecclesiastical history. There
        is, indeed, something at once grotesque and ghastly in the spectacle.
        The Donatists, having separated from the orthodox simply on the
        question of the validity of the consecration of a certain bishop,
        declared that all who adopted the orthodox view must be damned,
        refused to perform their rites in the orthodox churches which they
        had seized, till they had burnt the altar and scraped the wood, beat
        multitudes to death with clubs, blinded others by anointing their
        eyes with lime, filled Africa, during nearly two centuries, with war

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Together with
        these legislative and ecclesiastical measures, a literature arose
        surpassing in its mendacious ferocity any other the world had known.
        The polemical writers habitually painted as dæmons those who diverged
        from the orthodox belief, gloated with a vindictive piety over the
        sufferings of the heretic upon earth, as upon a Divine punishment,
        and sometimes, with an almost superhuman malice, passing in
        imagination beyond the threshold of the grave, exulted in no
        ambiguous terms on the tortures which they believed to be reserved
        for him for ever. A few men, such as Synesius, Basil, or Salvian,
        might still find some excellence in Pagans or heretics, but their
        candour was altogether exceptional; and he who will compare the
        beautiful pictures the Greek poets gave of their Trojan adversaries,
        or the Roman historians of the enemies of their country, with those
        which ecclesiastical writers, for many centuries, almost invariably
        gave of all who were opposed to their Church, may easily estimate the
        extent to which cosmopolitan sympathy had retrograded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the period,
        however, when the Western monasteries began to discharge their
        intellectual functions, the supremacy of Catholicism was nearly
        established, and polemical ardour had begun to wane. The literary
        zeal of the Church took other forms, but all were deeply tinged by
        the monastic spirit. It is difficult or impossible to conceive what
        would have been the intellectual future of the world had Catholicism
        never arisen—what principles or impulses would have guided the course
        of the human mind, or what new institutions <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> would have been created for its culture. Under
        the influence of Catholicism, the monastery became the one sphere of
        intellectual labour, and it continued during many centuries to occupy
        that position. Without entering into anything resembling a literary
        history, which would be foreign to the objects of the present work, I
        shall endeavour briefly to estimate the manner in which it discharged
        its functions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first idea
        that is naturally suggested by the mention of the intellectual
        services of monasteries is the preservation of the writings of the
        Pagans. I have already observed that among the early Christians there
        was a marked difference on the subject of their writings. The school
        which was represented by Tertullian regarded them with abhorrence;
        while the Platonists, who were represented by Justin Martyr, Clement
        of Alexandria, and Origen, not merely recognised with great
        cordiality their beauties, but even imagined that they could detect
        in them both the traces of an original Divine inspiration, and
        plagiarisms from the Jewish writings. While avoiding, for the most
        part, these extremes, St. Augustine, the great organiser of Western
        Christianity, treats the Pagan writings with appreciative respect. He
        had himself ascribed his first conversion from a course of vice to
        the 'Hortensius' of Cicero, and his works are full of discriminating,
        and often very beautiful, applications of the old Roman literature.
        The attempt of Julian to prevent the Christians from teaching the
        classics, and the extreme resentment which that attempt elicited,
        show how highly the Christian leaders of that period valued this form
        of education; and it was naturally the more cherished on account of
        the contest. The influence of Neoplatonism, the baptism of multitudes
        of nominal Christians after Constantine, and the decline of zeal
        which necessarily accompanied prosperity, had all in different ways
        the same tendency. In Synesius we have the curious phenomenon of a
        bishop who, not content with proclaiming himself the admiring friend
        of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name=
        "Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Pagan Hypatia, openly
        declared his complete disbelief in the resurrection of the body, and
        his firm adhesion to the Platonic doctrine of the pre-existence of
        souls.<a id="noteref_421" name="noteref_421" href=
        "#note_421"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">421</span></span></a> Had the
        ecclesiastical theory prevailed which gave such latitude even to the
        leaders of the Church, the course of Christianity would have been
        very different. A reactionary spirit, however, arose at Rome. The
        doctrine of exclusive salvation supplied its intellectual basis; the
        political and organising genius of the Roman ecclesiastics impelled
        them to reduce belief into a rigid form; the genius of St. Gregory
        guided the movement,<a id="noteref_422" name="noteref_422" href=
        "#note_422"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">422</span></span></a> and a
        series of historical events, of which the ecclesiastical and
        political separation of the Western empire from the speculative
        Greeks, and the invasion and conversion of the barbarians, were the
        most important, definitely established the ascendancy of the Catholic
        type. In the convulsions that followed the barbarian invasions,
        intellectual energy of a secular kind almost absolutely ceased. A
        parting gleam issued, indeed, in the sixth century, from the Court of
        Theodoric, at Ravenna, which was adorned by the genius of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202"
        id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Boëthius, and the talent of
        Cassiodorus and Symmachus, but after this time, for a long period,
        literature consisted almost exclusively of sermons and lives of
        saints, which were composed in the monasteries.<a id="noteref_423"
        name="noteref_423" href="#note_423"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">423</span></span></a> Gregory
        of Tours was succeeded as an annalist by the still feebler
        Fredegarius, and there was then a long and absolute blank. A few
        outlying countries showed some faint animation. St. Leander and St.
        Isidore planted at Seville a school, which flourished in the seventh
        century, and the distant monasteries of Ireland continued somewhat
        later to be the receptacles of learning; but the rest of Europe sank
        into an almost absolute torpor, till the rationalism of Abelard, and
        the events that followed the crusades, began the revival of learning.
        The principal service which Catholicism rendered during this period
        to Pagan literature was probably the perpetuation of Latin as a
        sacred language. The complete absence of all curiosity about that
        literature is shown by the fact that Greek was suffered to become
        almost absolutely extinct, though there was no time when the Western
        nations had not some relations with the Greek empire, or when
        pilgrimages to the Holy Land altogether ceased. The study of the
        Latin classics was for the most part positively discouraged. The
        writers, it was believed, were burning in hell; the monks were too
        inflated with their imaginary knowledge to regard with any respect a
        Pagan writer, and periodical panics about the approaching termination
        of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name=
        "Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> world continually
        checked any desire for secular learning.<a id="noteref_424" name=
        "noteref_424" href="#note_424"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">424</span></span></a> It was
        the custom among some monks, when they were under the discipline of
        silence, and desired to ask for Virgil, Horace, or any other Gentile
        work, to indicate their wish by scratching their ears like a dog, to
        which animal it was thought the Pagans might be reasonably
        compared.<a id="noteref_425" name="noteref_425" href=
        "#note_425"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">425</span></span></a> The
        monasteries contained, it is said, during some time, the only
        libraries in Europe, and were therefore the sole receptacles of the
        Pagan manuscripts; but we cannot infer from this that, if the
        monasteries had not existed, similar libraries would not have been
        called into being in their place. To the occasional industry of the
        monks, in copying the works of antiquity, we must oppose the industry
        they displayed, though chiefly at a somewhat later period, in
        scraping the ancient parchments, in order that, having obliterated
        the writing of the Pagans, they might cover them with their own
        legends.<a id="noteref_426" name="noteref_426" href=
        "#note_426"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are some
        aspects, however, in which the monastic period of literature appears
        eminently beautiful. The fretfulness <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> and impatience and extreme tension of modern
        literary life, the many anxieties that paralyse, and the feverish
        craving for applause that perverts, so many noble intellects, were
        then unknown. Severed from all the cares of active life, in the deep
        calm of the monastery, where the turmoil of the outer world could
        never come, the monkish scholar pursued his studies in a spirit which
        has now almost faded from the world. No doubt had ever disturbed his
        mind. To him the problem of the universe seemed solved. Expatiating
        for ever with unfaltering faith upon the unseen world, he had learnt
        to live for it alone. His hopes were not fixed upon human greatness
        or fame, but upon the pardon of his sins, and the rewards of a
        happier world. A crowd of quaint and often beautiful legends
        illustrate the deep union that subsisted between literature and
        religion. It is related of Cædmon, the first great poet of the
        Anglo-Saxons, that he found in the secular life no vent for his
        hidden genius. When the warriors assembled at their banquets, sang in
        turn the praises of war or beauty, as the instrument passed to him,
        he rose and went out with a sad heart, for he alone was unable to
        weave his thoughts in verse. Wearied and desponding he lay down to
        rest, when a figure appeared to him in his dream and commanded him to
        sing the Creation of the World. A transport of religious fervour
        thrilled his brain, his imprisoned intellect was unlocked, and he
        soon became the foremost poet of his land.<a id="noteref_427" name=
        "noteref_427" href="#note_427"><span class=

        Spanish boy, having long tried in vain to master his task, and driven
        to despair by the severity of his teacher, ran away from his father's
        home. Tired with wandering, and full of anxious thoughts, he sat down
        to rest by the margin of a well, when his eye was caught by the deep
        furrow in the stone. He asked a girl who was drawing water to explain
        it, and she told him that it had been worn by the constant attrition
        of the rope. The poor boy, who <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        written.<a id="noteref_429" name="noteref_429" href=

        imagining that the day had dawned, but on looking out she found that
        it was still night, though a dazzling splendour was around. A female
        form of matchless loveliness was bending over the scholar's grave.
        The effluence of her beauty filled the air with light, and she

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But legends of
        this kind, though not without a very real beauty, must not blind us
        to the fact that the period of Catholic ascendancy was on the whole
        one of the most deplorable in the history of the human mind. The
        energies of Christendom were diverted from all useful and progressive
        studies, and were wholly expended on theological disquisitions. A
        crowd of superstitions, attributed to infallible wisdom, barred the
        path of knowledge, and the charge of magic, or the charge of heresy,
        crushed every bold enquiry in the sphere of physical nature or of
        opinions. Above all, the conditions of true enquiry had been cursed
        by the Church. A blind unquestioning credulity was inculcated as the
        first of duties, and the habit of doubt, the impartiality of a
        suspended judgment, the desire to hear both sides of a disputed
        question, and to emancipate the judgment from unreasoning prejudice,
        were all in consequence condemned. The belief in the guilt of error
        and doubt became universal, and that belief may be confidently
        pronounced to be the most pernicious superstition that has ever been
        accredited among mankind. Mistaken facts are rectified by enquiry.
        Mistaken methods of research, though far more inveterate, are
        gradually altered; but the spirit that shrinks from enquiry as
        sinful, and deems a state of doubt a state of guilt, is the most
        enduring disease that can afflict the mind of man. Not till the
        education of Europe passed from the monasteries to the universities,
        not till Mohammedan science, and classical free-thought, and
        industrial independence broke the sceptre of the Church, did the
        intellectual revival of Europe begin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am aware that so
        strong a statement of the intellectual darkness of the middle ages is
        likely to encounter opposition <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> from many quarters. The blindness which the
        philosophers of the eighteenth century manifested to their better
        side has produced a reaction which has led many to an opposite, and,
        I believe, far more erroneous extreme. Some have become eulogists of
        the period, through love of its distinctive theological doctrines,
        and others through archæological enthusiasm, while a very pretentious
        and dogmatic, but, I think, sometimes superficial, school of writers,
        who loudly boast themselves the regenerators of history, and treat
        with supreme contempt all the varieties of theological opinion, are
        accustomed, partly through a very shallow historical optimism which
        scarcely admits the possibility of retrogression, and partly through
        sympathy with the despotic character of Catholicism, to extol the
        mediæval society in the most extravagant terms. Without entering into
        a lengthy examination of this subject, I may be permitted to indicate
        shortly two or three fallacies which are continually displayed in
        their appreciations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is an undoubted
        truth that, for a considerable period, almost all the knowledge of
        Europe was included in the monasteries, and from this it is
        continually inferred that, had these institutions not existed,
        knowledge would have been absolutely extinguished. But such a
        conclusion I conceive to be altogether untrue. During the period of
        the Pagan empire, intellectual life had been diffused over a vast
        portion of the globe. Egypt and Asia Minor had become great centres
        of civilisation. Greece was still a land of learning. Spain, Gaul,
        and even Britain,<a id="noteref_432" name="noteref_432" href=
        "#note_432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">432</span></span></a> were
        full of libraries and teachers. The schools of Narbonne, Arles,
        Bordeaux, Toulouse, Lyons, Marseilles, Poitiers, and Trèves were
        already famous. The Christian emperor Gratian, in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 376, carried out in
        Gaul a system similar to that which <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> had already, under the Antonines, been pursued
        in Italy, ordaining that teachers should be supported by the State in
        every leading city.<a id="noteref_433" name="noteref_433" href=
        "#note_433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">433</span></span></a> To
        suppose that Latin literature, having been so widely diffused, could
        have totally perished, or that all interest in it could have
        permanently ceased, even under the extremely unfavourable
        circumstances that followed the downfall of the Roman Empire and the
        Mohammedan invasions, is, I conceive, absurd. If Catholicism had
        never existed, the human mind would have sought other spheres for its
        development, and at least a part of the treasures of antiquity would
        have been preserved in other ways. The monasteries, as corporations
        of peaceful men protected from the incursions of the barbarians,
        became very naturally the reservoirs to which the streams of
        literature flowed; but much of what they are represented as creating,
        they had in reality only attracted. The inviolable sanctity which
        they secured rendered them invaluable receptacles of ancient learning
        in a period of anarchy and perpetual war, and the industry of the
        monks in transcribing, probably more than counterbalanced their
        industry in effacing, the classical writings. The ecclesiastical
        unity of Christendom was also of extreme importance in rendering
        possible a general interchange of ideas. Whether these services
        outweighed the intellectual evils resulting from the complete
        diversion of the human mind from all secular learning, and from the
        persistent inculcation, as a matter of duty, of that habit of abject
        credulity which it is the first task of the intellectual reformer to
        eradicate, may be reasonably doubted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
        unfrequent, again, to hear the preceding fallacy stated in a somewhat
        different form. We are reminded that almost all the men of genius
        during several centuries were great theologians, and we are asked to
        conceive the more than Egyptian darkness that would have prevailed
        had the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name=
        "Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Catholic theology
        which produced them not existed. This judgment resembles that of the
        prisoner in a famous passage of Cicero, who, having spent his entire
        life in a dark dungeon, and knowing the light of day only from a
        single ray which passed through a fissure in the wall, inferred that
        if the wall were removed, as the fissure would no longer exist, all
        light would be excluded. Mediæval Catholicism discouraged and
        suppressed in every way secular studies, while it conferred a
        monopoly of wealth and honour and power upon the distinguished
        theologian. Very naturally, therefore, it attracted into the path of
        theology the genius that would have existed without it, but would
        under other circumstances have been displayed in other forms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not to be
        inferred, however, from this, that mediæval Catholicism had not, in
        the sphere of intellect, any real creative power. A great moral or
        religious enthusiasm always evokes a certain amount of genius that
        would not otherwise have existed, or at least been displayed, and the
        monasteries were peculiarly fitted to develop certain casts of mind,
        which in no other sphere could have so perfectly expanded. The great
        writings of St. Thomas Aquinas<a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434"
        href="#note_434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">434</span></span></a> and his
        followers, and, in more modern times, the massive and conscientious
        erudition of the Benedictines, will always make certain periods of
        the monastic history venerable to the scholar. But, when we remember
        that during many centuries nearly every one possessing any literary
        taste or talents became a monk, when we recollect that these monks
        were familiar with the language, and might easily have been familiar
        with the noble literature, of ancient Rome, and when <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> we also consider the mode of their life,
        which would seem, from its freedom from care, and from the very
        monotony of its routine, peculiarly calculated to impel them to
        study, we can hardly fail to wonder how very little of any real value
        they added, for so long a period, to the knowledge of mankind. It is
        indeed a remarkable fact that, even in the ages when the Catholic
        ascendancy was most perfect, some of the greatest achievements were
        either opposed or simply external to ecclesiastical influence. Roger
        Bacon, having been a monk, is frequently spoken of as a creature of
        Catholic teaching. But there never was a more striking instance of
        the force of a great genius in resisting the tendencies of his age.
        At a time when physical science was continually neglected,
        discouraged, or condemned, at a time when all the great prizes of the
        world were open to men who pursued a very different course, Bacon
        applied himself with transcendent genius to the study of nature.
        Fourteen years of his life were spent in prison, and when he died his
        name was blasted as a magician. The mediæval laboratories were
        chiefly due to the pursuit of alchemy, or to Mohammedan
        encouragement. The inventions of the mariner's compass, of gunpowder,
        and of rag paper were all, indeed, of extreme importance; but no part
        of the credit of them belongs to the monks. Their origin is involved
        in much obscurity, but it is almost certain that the last two, at all
        events, were first employed in Europe by the Mohammedans of Spain.
        Cotton paper was in use among these as early as 1009. Among the
        Christian nations it appears to have been unknown till late in the
        thirteenth century. The first instance of the employment of artillery
        among Christian nations was at the battle of Crecy, but the knowledge
        of gunpowder among them has been traced back as far as 1338. There is
        abundant evidence, however, of its employment in Spain by Mohammedans
        in several sieges in the thirteenth century, and even in a battle
        between the Moors of Seville and those of Tunis at the end of the
        eleventh <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg
        211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        century.<a id="noteref_435" name="noteref_435" href=
        "#note_435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">435</span></span></a> In
        invention, indeed, as well as in original research, the mediæval
        monasteries were singularly barren. They cultivated formal logic to
        great perfection. They produced many patient and laborious, though,
        for the most part, wholly uncritical scholars, and many philosophers
        who, having assumed their premises with unfaltering faith, reasoned
        from them with admirable subtlety; but they taught men to regard the
        sacrifice of secular learning as a noble thing; they impressed upon
        them a theory of the habitual government of the universe, which is
        absolutely untrue; and they diffused, wherever their influence
        extended, habits of credulity and intolerance that are the most
        deadly poisons to the human mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is, again, very
        frequently observed among the more philosophic eulogists of the
        mediæval period, that although the Catholic Church is a trammel and
        an obstacle to the progress of civilised nations, although it would
        be scarcely possible to exaggerate the misery her persecuting spirit
        caused, when the human mind had outstripped her teaching; yet there
        was a time when she was greatly in advance of the age, and the
        complete and absolute ascendancy she then exercised was
        intellectually eminently beneficial. That there is much truth in this
        view, I have myself repeatedly maintained. But when men proceed to
        isolate the former period, and to make it the theme of unqualified
        eulogy, they fall, I think, into a grave error. The evils that sprang
        from the later period of Catholic ascendancy were not an accident or
        a perversion, but a normal and necessary consequence of the previous
        despotism. The principles which were imposed on the mediæval world,
        and which were the conditions of so <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> much of its distinctive excellence, were of
        such a nature that they claimed to be final, and could not possibly
        be discarded without a struggle and a convulsion. We must estimate
        the influence of these principles considered as a whole, and during
        the entire period of their operation. There are some poisons which,
        before they kill men, allay pain and diffuse a soothing sensation
        through the frame. We may recognise the hour of enjoyment they
        procure, but we must not separate it from the price at which it is
        purchased.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The extremely
        unfavourable influence the Catholic Church long exercised upon
        intellectual development had important moral consequences. Although
        moral progress does not necessarily depend upon intellectual progress
        it is materially affected by it, intellectual activity being the most
        important element in the growth of that great and complex organism
        which we call civilisation. The mediæval credulity had also a more
        direct moral influence in producing that indifference to truth, which
        is the most repulsive feature of so many Catholic writings. The very
        large part that must be assigned to deliberate forgeries in the early
        apologetic literature of the Church we have already seen; and no
        impartial reader can, I think, investigate the innumerable grotesque
        and lying legends that, during the whole course of the Middle Ages,
        were deliberately palmed upon mankind as undoubted facts, can follow
        the histories of the false decretals, and the discussions that were
        connected with them, or can observe the complete and absolute
        incapacity most Catholic historians have displayed, of conceiving any
        good thing in the ranks of their opponents, or of stating with common
        fairness any consideration that can tell against their cause, without
        acknowledging how serious and how inveterate has been the evil. There
        have, no doubt, been many noble individual exceptions. Yet it is, I
        believe, difficult to exaggerate the extent to which this moral
        defect exists in most of the ancient and very much of the modern
        literature of Catholicism. It <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> is this which makes it so unspeakably repulsive
        to all independent and impartial thinkers, and has led a great German
        historian<a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href=
        "#note_436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a> to
        declare, with much bitterness, that the phrase Christian veracity
        deserves to rank with the phrase Punic faith. But this absolute
        indifference to truth whenever falsehood could subserve the interests
        of the Church is perfectly explicable, and was found in multitudes
        who, in other respects, exhibited the noblest virtue. An age which
        has ceased to value impartiality of judgment will soon cease to value
        accuracy of statement; and when credulity is inculcated as a virtue,
        falsehood will not long be stigmatised as a vice. When, too, men are
        firmly convinced that salvation can only be found within their
        Church, and that their Church can absolve from all guilt, they will
        speedily conclude that nothing can possibly be wrong which is
        beneficial to it. They exchange the love of truth for what they call
        the love of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the</span></em> truth. They regard morals as
        derived from and subordinate to theology, and they regulate all their
        statements, not by the standard of veracity, but by the interests of
        their creed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another important
        moral consequence of the monastic system was the great prominence
        given to pecuniary compensations for crime. It had been at first one
        of the broad distinctions between Paganism and Christianity, that,
        while the rites of the former were for the most part unconnected with
        moral dispositions, Christianity made purity of heart an essential
        element of all its worship. Among the Pagans a few faint efforts had,
        it is true, been made in this direction. An old precept or law, which
        is referred to by Cicero, and which was strongly reiterated by
        Apollonius of Tyana, and the Pythagoreans, declared that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“no impious man should dare to appease the anger of the
        divinities by gifts;”</span><a id="noteref_437" name="noteref_437"
        href="#note_437"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">437</span></span></a> and
        oracles are said to have more than once proclaimed that the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214"
        id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> hecatombs of noble oxen with
        gilded horns that were offered up ostentatiously by the rich, were
        less pleasing to the gods than the wreaths of flowers and the modest
        and reverential worship of the poor.<a id="noteref_438" name=
        "noteref_438" href="#note_438"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a> In
        general, however, in the Pagan world, the service of the temple had
        little or no connection with morals, and the change which
        Christianity effected in this respect was one of its most important
        benefits to mankind. It was natural, however, and perhaps inevitable,
        that in the course of time, and under the action of very various
        causes, the old Pagan sentiment should revive, and even with an
        increased intensity. In no respect had the Christians been more nobly
        distinguished than by their charity. It was not surprising that the
        Fathers, while exerting all their eloquence to stimulate this
        virtue—especially during the calamities that accompanied the
        dissolution of the Empire—should have dilated in extremely strong
        terms upon the spiritual benefits the donor would receive for his
        gift. It is also not surprising that this selfish calculation should
        gradually, and among hard and ignorant men, have absorbed all other
        motives. A curious legend, which is related by a writer of the
        seventh century, illustrates the kind of feeling that had arisen. The
        Christian bishop Synesius succeeded in converting a Pagan named
        Evagrius, who for a long time, however, felt doubts about the
        passage, <span class="tei tei-q">“He who giveth to the poor lendeth
        to the Lord.”</span> On his conversion, and in obedience to this
        verse, he gave Synesius three hundred pieces of gold to be
        distributed among the poor; but he exacted from the bishop, as the
        representative of Christ, a promissory note, engaging that he should
        be repaid in the future world. Many years later, Evagrius, being on
        his death-bed, commanded his sons, when they buried him, to place the
        note in his hand, and to do so without informing Synesius. His
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215"
        id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dying injunction was observed,
        and three days afterwards he appeared to Synesius in a dream, told
        him that the debt had been paid, and ordered him to go to the tomb,
        where he would find a written receipt. Synesius did as he was
        commanded, and, the grave being opened, the promissory note was found
        in the hand of the dead man, with an endorsement declaring that the
        debt had been paid by Christ. The note, it was said, was long after
        preserved as a relic in the church of Cyrene.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The kind of
        feeling which this legend displays was soon turned with tenfold force
        into the channel of monastic life. A law of Constantine accorded, and
        several later laws enlarged, the power of bequests to ecclesiastics.
        Ecclesiastical property was at the same time exonerated from the
        public burdens, and this measure not only directly assisted its
        increase, but had also an important indirect influence; for, when
        taxation was heavy, many laymen ceded the ownership of their estates
        to the monasteries, with a secret condition that they should, as
        vassals, receive the revenues unburdened by taxation, and subject
        only to a slight payment to the monks as to their feudal lords.<a id=
        "noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href="#note_439"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a> The
        monks were regarded as the trustees of the poor, and also as
        themselves typical poor, and all the promises that applied to those
        who gave to the poor applied, it was said, to the benefactors of the
        monasteries. The monastic chapel also contained the relics of saints
        or sacred images of miraculous power, and throngs of worshippers
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216"
        id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> were attracted by the
        miracles, and desired to place themselves under the protection, of
        the saint. It is no exaggeration to say that to give money to the
        priests was for several centuries the first article of the moral
        code. Political minds may have felt the importance of aggrandising a
        pacific and industrious class in the centre of a disorganised
        society, and family affection may have predisposed many in favour of
        institutions which contained at least one member of most families;
        but in the overwhelming majority of cases the motive was simple
        superstition. In seasons of sickness, of danger, of sorrow, or of
        remorse, whenever the fear or the conscience of the worshipper was
        awakened, he hastened to purchase with money the favour of a saint.
        Above all, in the hour of death, when the terrors of the future world
        loomed darkly upon his mind, he saw in a gift or legacy to the monks
        a sure means of effacing the most monstrous crimes, and securing his
        ultimate happiness. A rich man was soon scarcely deemed a Christian
        if he did not leave a portion of his property to the Church, and the
        charters of innumerable monasteries in every part of Europe attest
        the vast tracts of land that were ceded by will to the monks,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“for the benefit of the soul”</span> of the

        observed by a great historian that we may trace three distinct phases
        in the early history of the Church. In the first period religion was
        a question of morals; in the second period, which culminated in the
        fifth century, it had become a question of orthodoxy; in the third
        period, which dates from the seventh century, it was a question of
        munificence to monasteries.<a id="noteref_441" name="noteref_441"

        invasions, had repressed the struggles of heresy, and in the period
        of almost absolute darkness that continued from the sixth to the
        twelfth century, the theological ideal of unquestioning faith and of
        perfect unanimity was all but realised in the West. All the energy
        that in previous ages had been expended in combating heresy was now
        expended in acquiring wealth. The people compounded for the most
        atrocious crimes by gifts to shrines of those saints whose
        intercession was supposed to be unfailing. The monks, partly by the
        natural cessation of their old enthusiasm, partly by the absence of
        any hostile criticism of their acts, and partly too by the very
        wealth they had acquired, sank into gross and general immorality. The
        great majority of them had probably at no time been either saints
        actuated by a strong religious motive, nor yet diseased and
        desponding minds seeking a refuge from the world; they had been
        simply peasants, of no extraordinary devotion or sensitiveness, who
        preferred an ensured subsistence, with no care, little labour, a much
        higher social position than they could otherwise acquire, and the
        certainty, as they believed, of going to heaven, to the laborious and
        precarious existence of the serf, relieved, indeed, by the privilege
        of marriage, but exposed to military service, to extreme hardships,
        and to constant oppression. Very naturally, when they could do so
        with impunity, they broke their vows of chastity. Very naturally,
        too, they availed themselves to the full of the condition of affairs,
        to draw as much wealth as possible into their community.<a id=

        of the world, especially at the close of the tenth century, the
        crusades, which gave rise to a profitable traffic in the form of a
        pecuniary commutation of vows, and the black death, which produced a
        paroxysm of religious fanaticism, stimulated the movement. In the
        monkish chronicles, the merits of sovereigns are almost exclusively
        judged by their bounty to the Church, and in some cases this is the
        sole part of their policy which has been preserved.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were, no
        doubt, a few redeeming points in this dark period. The Irish monks
        are said to have been honourably distinguished for their reluctance
        to accept the lavish donations of their admirers,<a id="noteref_444"
        name="noteref_444" href="#note_444"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        some missionary monasteries of a high order of excellence were
        scattered through Europe. A few legends, too, may be cited censuring
        the facility with which money acquired by crime was accepted as an
        atonement for crime.<a id="noteref_445" name="noteref_445" href=
        "#note_445"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445</span></span></a> But
        these cases were very rare, and the religious history of several
        centuries is little more than a history of the rapacity of priests
        and of the credulity of laymen. In <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> England, the perpetual demands of the Pope
        excited a fierce resentment; and we may trace with remarkable
        clearness, in every page of Matthew Paris, the alienation of sympathy
        arising from this cause, which prepared and foreshadowed the final
        rupture of England from the Church. Ireland, on the other hand, had
        been given over by two Popes to the English invader, on the condition
        of the payment of Peter's pence. The outrageous and notorious
        immorality of the monasteries, during the century before the
        Reformation, was chiefly due to their great wealth; and that
        immorality, as the writings of Erasmus and Ulric von Hutten show,
        gave a powerful impulse to the new movement, while the abuses of the
        indulgences were the immediate cause of the revolt of Luther. But
        these things arrived only after many centuries of successful fraud.
        The religious terrorism that was unscrupulously employed had done its
        work, and the chief riches of Christendom had passed into the coffers
        of the Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is, indeed,
        probable that religious terrorism played a more important part in the
        monastic phase of Christianity than it had done even in the great
        work of the conversion of the Pagans. Although two or three amiable
        theologians had made faint and altogether abortive attempts to
        question the eternity of punishment; although there had been some
        slight difference of opinion concerning the future of some Pagan
        philosophers who had lived before the introduction of Christianity,
        and also upon the question whether infants who died unbaptised were
        only deprived of all joy, or were actually subjected to never-ending
        agony, there was no question as to the main features of the Catholic
        doctrine. According to the patristic theologians, it was part of the
        gospel revelation that the misery and suffering the human race
        endures upon earth is but a feeble image of that which awaits it in
        the future world; that all its members beyond the Church, as well as
        a very large proportion of those who are within its pale, are doomed
        to an eternity of agony in a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> literal and undying fire. The monastic legends
        took up this doctrine, which in itself is sufficiently revolting, and
        they developed it with an appalling vividness and minuteness. St.
        Macarius, it is said, when walking one day through the desert, saw a
        skull upon the ground. He struck it with his staff and it began to
        speak. It told him that it was the skull of a Pagan priest who had
        lived before the introduction of Christianity into the world, and who
        had accordingly been doomed to hell. As high as the heaven is above
        the earth, so high does the fire of hell mount in waves above the
        souls that are plunged into it. The damned souls were pressed
        together back to back, and the lost priest made it his single
        entreaty to the saint that he would pray that they might be turned
        face to face, for he believed that the sight of a brother's face
        might afford him some faint consolation in the eternity of agony that
        was before him.<a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446" href=
        "#note_446"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">446</span></span></a> The
        story is well known of how St. Gregory, seeing on a bas-relief a
        representation of the goodness of Trajan to a poor widow, pitied the
        Pagan emperor, whom he knew to be in hell, and prayed that he might
        be released. He was told that his prayer was altogether
        unprecedented; but at last, on his promising that he would never
        offer such a prayer again, it was partially granted. Trajan was not
        withdrawn from hell, but he was freed from the torments which the
        remainder of the Pagan world endured.<a id="noteref_447" name=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> hell was soon produced by the industry of
        the monks. The apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, which purported to
        describe the descent of Christ into the lower world, contributed to
        foster it; and St. Gregory the Great has related many visions in a
        more famous work, which professed to be compiled with scrupulous
        veracity from the most authentic sources,<a id="noteref_448" name=

        which it may be confidently averred that it scarcely contains a
        single page which is not tainted with grotesque and deliberate
        falsehood. Men, it was said, passed into a trance or temporary death,
        and were then carried for a time to hell. Among others, a certain man
        named Stephen, from whose lips the saint declares that he had heard
        the tale, had died by mistake. When his soul was borne to the gates
        of hell, the Judge declared that it was another Stephen who was
        wanted; the disembodied spirit, after inspecting hell, was restored
        to its former body, and the next day it was known that another
        Stephen had died.<a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href=

        Volcanoes were the portals of hell, and a hermit had seen the soul of
        the Arian emperor Theodoric, as St. Eucherius afterwards did the soul
        of Charles Martel, carried down that in the Island of Lipari.<a id=

        craters in Sicily, it was remarked, were continually agitated, and
        continually increasing, and this, as St. Gregory observes, was
        probably due to the impending ruin of the world, when the great press
        of lost souls would render it necessary to enlarge the approaches to
        their prisons.<a id="noteref_451" name="noteref_451" href=

        of hell that are furnished in the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Dialogues”</span> of St. Gregory appear meagre and
        unimaginative, compared with those of some later monks. A long series
        of monastic visions, of which that of St. Fursey, in the seventh
        century, was one of the first, and which followed <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in rapid succession, till that of

        impossible to conceive more ghastly, grotesque, and material
        conceptions of the future world than they evince, or more hideous
        calumnies against that Being who was supposed to inflict upon His
        creatures such unspeakable misery. The devil was represented bound by
        red-hot chains, on a burning gridiron in the centre of hell. The
        screams of his never-ending agony made its rafters to resound; but
        his hands were free, and with these he seized the lost souls, crushed
        them like grapes against his teeth, and then drew them by his breath
        down the fiery cavern of his throat. Dæmons with hooks of red-hot
        iron plunged souls alternately into fire and ice. Some of the lost
        were hung up by their tongues, others were sawn asunder, others
        gnawed by serpents, others beaten together on an anvil and welded
        into a single mass, others boiled and then strained through a cloth,
        others twined in the embraces of dæmons whose limbs were of flame.
        The fire of earth, it was said, was but a picture of that of hell.
        The latter was so immeasurably more intense that it alone could be
        called real. Sulphur was mixed with it, partly to increase its heat,
        and partly, too, in order that an insufferable stench might be added
        to the misery of the lost, while, unlike other flames, it emitted,
        according to some visions, no light, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> that the horror of darkness might be added to
        the horror of pain. A narrow bridge spanned the abyss, and from it
        the souls of sinners were plunged into the darkness that was
        below.<a id="noteref_453" name="noteref_453" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such catalogues of
        horrors, though they now awake in an educated man a sentiment of
        mingled disgust, weariness, and contempt, were able for many
        centuries to create a degree of panic and of misery we can scarcely
        realise. With the exception of the heretic Pelagius, whose noble
        genius, anticipating the discoveries of modern science, had
        repudiated the theological notion of death having been introduced
        into the world on account of the act of Adam, it was universally held
        among Christians that all the forms of suffering and dissolution that
        are manifested on earth were penal inflictions. The destruction of
        the world was generally believed to be at hand. The minds of men were
        filled with images of the approaching catastrophe, and innumerable
        legends of visible dæmons were industriously circulated. It was the
        custom then, as it is the custom now, for Catholic priests to stain
        the imaginations of young children by ghastly pictures of future
        misery, to imprint upon the virgin mind atrocious images which they
        hoped, not unreasonably, might prove indelible.<a id="noteref_454"

        hovering around, and hell itself yawning to receive its victim. St.
        Gregory describes how a monk, who, though apparently a man of
        exemplary and even saintly piety, had been accustomed secretly to eat
        meat, saw on his deathbed a fearful dragon twining its tail round his
        body, and, with open jaws, sucking his breath;<a id="noteref_455"

        a little boy of five years old, who had learnt from his father to

        forlorn, and its brightness and beauty suggested no ideas but those
        of deception and of sin. The redbreast, according to one popular
        legend, was commissioned by the Deity to carry a drop of water to the
        souls of unbaptised infants in hell, and its breast was singed in

        that were wrung from the sufferers, the cry broke from his lips,

        indeed, one of the most curious things in moral history, to observe
        how men who were sincerely indignant with Pagan writers for
        attributing to their divinities the frailties of an occasional
        jealousy or an occasional sensuality—for representing them, in a
        word, like men of mingled characters and passions—have nevertheless
        unscrupulously attributed to their own Divinity a degree of cruelty
        which may be confidently said to transcend the utmost barbarity of
        which human nature is capable. Neither Nero nor Phalaris could have
        looked complacently for ever on millions enduring the torture of
        fire—most of them because of a crime which was committed, not by
        themselves, but by their ancestors, or because they had adopted some

        once realised it, and accepted it with pleasure, into a monster of
        barbarity. Of the writers of the mediæval period, certainly one of
        the two or three most eminent was Peter Lombard, whose <span class=

        Nor is the work unworthy of its former reputation. Calm, clear,
        logical, subtle, and concise, the author professes to expound

        id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the whole system of Catholic
        theology and ethics, and to reveal the interdependence of their
        various parts. Having explained the position and the duties, he
        proceeds to examine the prospects, of man. He maintains that until
        the day of judgment the inhabitants of heaven and hell will
        continually see one another; but that, in the succeeding eternity,
        the inhabitants of heaven alone will see those of the opposite world;
        and he concludes his great work by this most impressive passage:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“In the last place, we must enquire whether
        the sight of the punishment of the condemned will impair the glory of
        the blest, or whether it will augment their beatitude. Concerning
        this, Gregory says the sight of the punishment of the lost will not
        obscure the beatitude of the just; for when it is accompanied by no
        compassion it can be no diminution of happiness. And although their
        own joys might suffice to the just, yet to their greater glory they
        will see the pains of the evil, which by grace they have escaped....
        The elect will go forth, not indeed locally, but by intelligence, and
        by a clear vision, to behold the torture of the impious, and as they
        see them they will not grieve. Their minds will be sated with joy as
        they gaze on the unspeakable anguish of the impious, returning thanks
        for their own freedom. Thus Esaias, describing the torments of the
        impious, and the joy of the righteous in witnessing it, says:
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘The elect in truth will go out and will see
        the corpses of men who have prevaricated against Him; their worm will
        not die, and they will be to the satiety of vision to all flesh, that
        is to the elect. The just man will rejoice when he shall see the
        vengeance.’</span> ”</span><a id="noteref_462" name="noteref_462"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This passion for
        visions of heaven and hell was, in fact, a natural continuation of
        the passion for dogmatic definition, which had raged during the fifth
        century. It was natural that men, whose curiosity had left no
        conceivable question of theology undefined, should have endeavoured
        to describe with corresponding precision the condition of the dead.
        Much, however, was due to the hallucinations of solitary and ascetic
        life, and much more to deliberate imposture. It is impossible for men
        to continue long in a condition of extreme panic, and superstition
        speedily discovered remedies to allay the fears it had created. If a
        malicious dæmon was hovering around the believer, and if the jaws of
        hell were opening to receive him, he was defended, on the other hand,
        by countless angels; a lavish gift to a church or monastery could
        always enlist a saint in his behalf, and priestly power could protect
        him against the dangers which priestly sagacity had revealed. When
        the angels were weighing the good and evil deeds of a dead man, the
        latter were found by far to preponderate; but a priest of St.
        Lawrence came in, and turned the scale by throwing down among the
        former a heavy gold chalice, which the deceased had given to the
        altar.<a id="noteref_463" name="noteref_463" href=

        acquire the patronage of saints, to endow monasteries, to build
        churches, became the chief part of religion, and the more the terrors
        of the unseen world were unfolded, the more men sought tranquillity
        by the consolations of superstition.<a id="noteref_466" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The extent to
        which the custom of materialising religion was carried, can only be
        adequately realised by those who have examined the mediæval
        literature itself. That which strikes a student in perusing this
        literature, is not so much the existence of these superstitions, as
        their extraordinary multiplication, the many thousands of grotesque
        miracles wrought by saints, monasteries, or relics, that were
        deliberately asserted and universally believed. Christianity had
        assumed a form that was quite as polytheistic and quite as idolatrous
        as the ancient Paganism. The low level of intellectual cultivation,
        the religious feelings of half-converted barbarians, the interests of
        the clergy, the great social importance of the monasteries, and
        perhaps also the custom of compounding for nearly all crimes by
        pecuniary fines, which was so general in the penal system of the
        barbarian tribes, combined in their different ways, with the panic
        created by the fear of hell, in driving men in the same direction,
        and the wealth and power of the clergy rose to a point that enabled
        them to overshadow all other classes. They had found, as has been
        well said, in another world, the standing-point <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Archimedes from which they could move
        this. No other system had ever appeared so admirably fitted to endure
        for ever. The Church had crushed or silenced every opponent in
        Christendom. It had an absolute control over education in all its
        branches and in all its stages. It had absorbed all the speculative
        knowledge and art of Europe. It possessed or commanded wealth, rank,
        and military power. It had so directed its teaching, that everything
        which terrified or distressed mankind drove men speedily into its
        arms, and it had covered Europe with a vast network of institutions,
        admirably adapted to extend and perpetuate its power. In addition to
        all this, it had guarded with consummate skill all the approaches to
        its citadel. Every doubt was branded as a sin, and a long course of
        doubt must necessarily have preceded the rejection of its tenets. All
        the avenues of enquiry were painted with images of appalling
        suffering, and of malicious dæmons. No sooner did the worshipper
        begin to question any article of faith, or to lose his confidence in
        the virtue of the ceremonies of his Church, than he was threatened
        with a doom that no human heroism could brave, that no imagination
        could contemplate undismayed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of all the
        suffering that was undergone by those brave men who in ages of
        ignorance and superstition dared to break loose from the trammels of
        their Church, and who laid the foundation of the liberty we now
        enjoy, it is this which was probably the most poignant, and which is
        the least realised. Our imaginations can reproduce with much
        vividness gigantic massacres like those of the Albigenses or of St.
        Bartholomew. We can conceive, too, the tortures of the rack and of
        the boots, the dungeon, the scaffold, and the slow fire. We can
        estimate, though less perfectly, the anguish which the bold enquirer
        must have undergone from the desertion of those he most dearly loved,
        from the hatred of mankind, from the malignant calumnies that were
        heaped <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name=
        "Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> upon his name. But in
        the chamber of his own soul, in the hours of his solitary meditation,
        he must have found elements of a suffering that was still more acute.
        Taught from his earliest childhood to regard the abandonment of his
        hereditary opinions as the most deadly of crimes, and to ascribe it
        to the instigation of deceiving dæmons, persuaded that if he died in
        a condition of doubt he must pass into a state of everlasting
        torture, his imagination saturated with images of the most hideous
        and appalling anguish, he found himself alone in the world,
        struggling with his difficulties and his doubts. There existed no
        rival sect in which he could take refuge, and where, in the professed
        agreement of many minds, he could forget the anathemas of the Church.
        Physical science, that has disproved the theological theories which
        attribute death to human sin, and suffering to Divine vengeance, and
        all natural phenomena to isolated acts of Divine
        intervention—historical criticism, which has dispelled so many
        imposing fabrics of belief, traced so many elaborate superstitions to
        the normal action of the undisciplined imagination, and explained and
        defined the successive phases of religious progress, were both
        unknown. Every comet that blazed in the sky, every pestilence that
        swept over the land, appeared a confirmation of the dark threats of
        the theologian. A spirit of blind and abject credulity, inculcated as
        the first of duties, and exhibited on all subjects and in all forms,
        pervaded the atmosphere he breathed. Who can estimate aright the
        obstacles against which a sincere enquirer in such an age must have
        struggled? Who can conceive the secret anguish he must have endured
        in the long months or years during which rival arguments gained an
        alternate sway over his judgment, while all doubt was still regarded
        as damnable? And even when his mind was convinced, his imagination
        would still often revert to his old belief. Our thoughts in after
        years flow spontaneously, and even unconsciously, in the channels
        that are formed in youth. In <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> moments when the controlling judgment has
        relaxed its grasp, old intellectual habits reassume their sway, and
        images painted on the imagination will live, when the intellectual
        propositions on which they rested have been wholly abandoned. In
        hours of weakness, of sickness, and of drowsiness, in the feverish
        and anxious moments that are known to all, when the mind floats
        passively upon the stream, the phantoms which reason had exorcised
        must have often reappeared, and the bitterness of an ancient tyranny
        must have entered into his soul.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is one of the
        greatest of the many services that were rendered to mankind by the
        Troubadours, that they cast such a flood of ridicule upon the visions
        of hell, by which the monks had been accustomed to terrify mankind,
        that they completely discredited and almost suppressed them.<a id=

        Whether, however, the Catholic mind, if unassisted by the literature
        of Paganism and by the independent thinkers who grew up under the
        shelter of Mohammedanism, could have ever unwound the chains that had
        bound it, may well be questioned. The growth of towns, which
        multiplied secular interests and feelings, the revival of learning,
        the depression of the ecclesiastical classes that followed the
        crusades, and, at last, the dislocation of Christendom by the
        Reformation, gradually impaired the ecclesiastical doctrine, which
        ceased to be realised before it ceased to be believed. There was,
        however, another doctrine which exercised a still greater influence
        in augmenting the riches of the clergy, and in making donations to
        the Church the chief part of religion. I allude, of course, to the
        doctrine of purgatory.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A distinguished
        modern apologist for the middle ages has made this doctrine the
        object of his special and very characteristic eulogy, because, as he
        says, by providing a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg
        233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        finite punishment graduated to every variety of guilt, and adapted
        for those who, without being sufficiently virtuous to pass at once
        into heaven, did not appear sufficiently vicious to pass into hell,
        it formed an indispensable corrective to the extreme terrorism of the
        doctrine of eternal punishment.<a id="noteref_468" name="noteref_468"
        href="#note_468"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">468</span></span></a> This is
        one of those theories which, though exceedingly popular with a class
        of writers who are not without influence in our day, must appear, I
        think, almost grotesque to those who have examined the actual
        operation of the doctrine during the middle ages. According to the
        practical teaching of the Church, the expiatory powers at the
        disposal of its clergy were so great, that those who died believing
        its doctrines, and fortified in their last hours by its rites, had no
        cause whatever to dread the terrors of hell. On the other hand, those
        who died external to the Church had no prospect of entering into
        purgatory. This latter was designed altogether for true believers; it
        was chiefly preached at a time when no one was in the least disposed
        to question the powers of the Church to absolve any crime, however
        heinous, or to free the worst men from hell, and it was assuredly
        never regarded in the light of a consolation. Indeed, the popular
        pictures of purgatory were so terrific that it may be doubted whether
        the imagination could ever fully realise, though the reason could
        easily recognise, the difference between this state and that of the
        lost. The fire of purgatory, according to the most eminent
        theologians, was like the fire of hell—a literal fire, prolonged, it
        was sometimes said, for ages. The declamations of the pulpit
        described the sufferings of the saved souls in purgatory as
        incalculably greater than any that were endured by the most wretched
        mortals upon earth.<a id="noteref_469" name="noteref_469" href=

        monk, who described what he professed to have seen, usually ended by
        the characteristic moral, that could men only realise those
        sufferings, they would shrink from no sacrifice to rescue their
        friends from such a state. A special place, it was said, was reserved
        in purgatory for those who had been slow in paying their
        tithes.<a id="noteref_471" name="noteref_471" href=

        a contested election for the popedom, supported the wrong candidate,
        and without, as it would appear, in any degree refusing to obey the
        successful candidate when elected, continued secretly of opinion that
        the choice was an unwise one. He was accordingly placed for some time

        Whatever may be thought of its other aspects, it is impossible to
        avoid recognising in this teaching a masterly skill in the adaptation
        of means to ends, which almost rises to artistic beauty. A system
        which deputed its minister to go to the unhappy widow in the first
        dark hour of her anguish and her desolation, to tell her that he who
        was dearer to her than all the world besides was now burning in a
        fire, and that he could only be relieved by a gift of money to the
        priests, was assuredly of its own kind not without an extraordinary
        merit.</p>

        realise the moral condition of the society of Western Europe in the
        period that elapsed between the downfall of the Roman Empire and
        Charlemagne, during which the religious transformations I have
        noticed chiefly arose, we shall be met by some formidable
        difficulties. In the first place, our materials are very scanty. From

        doubtful notices in the chronicles of monasteries, the lives of
        saints, and the decrees of Councils. All secular literature had

        tedious and repulsive pages illustrate with considerable clearness
        the conflict of races and the dislocation of governments that for
        centuries existed. In Italy, the traditions and habits of the old
        Empire had in some degree reasserted their sway; but in Gaul the
        Church subsisted in the midst of barbarians, whose native vigour had
        never been emasculated by civilisation and refined by knowledge. The
        picture which Gregory of Tours gives us is that of a society which
        was almost absolutely anarchical. The mind is fatigued by the
        monotonous account of acts of violence and of fraud springing from no

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The manner in

        characteristic. Our principal authority, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        student who turns to his pages from those of the Pagan historians, is
        not more struck by the extreme prominence he gives to ecclesiastical
        events, than by the uniform manner in which he views all secular
        events in their religious aspect, as governed and directed by a
        special Providence. Yet, in questions where the difference between
        orthodoxy and heterodoxy is concerned, his ethics sometimes exhibit
        the most singular distortion. Of this, probably the most impressive
        example is the manner in which he has described the career of Clovis,
        the great representative of orthodoxy.<a id="noteref_499" name=
        "noteref_499" href="#note_499"><span class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">499</span></span></a> Having
        recounted the circumstances of his conversion, Gregory proceeds to
        tell us, with undisguised admiration, how that chieftain, as the
        first-fruits of his doctrine, professed to be grieved at seeing that
        part of Gaul was held by an Arian sovereign; how he accordingly
        resolved to invade and appropriate that territory; how, with
        admirable piety, he commanded his soldiers to abstain from all
        devastations when traversing the territory of St. Martin, and how
        several miracles attested the Divine approbation of the expedition.
        The war—which is the first of the long series of professedly
        religious wars that have been undertaken by Christians—was fully
        successful, and Clovis proceeded to direct his ambition to new
        fields. In his expedition against the Arians, he had found a faithful
        ally in his relative Sighebert, the old and infirm king of the
        Ripuarian Franks. Clovis now proceeded artfully to suggest to the son
        of Sighebert the advantages that son might obtain by his father's
        death. The hint was taken. Sighebert was murdered, and Clovis
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241"
        id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sent ambassadors to the
        parricide, professing a warm friendship, but with secret orders on
        the first opportunity to kill him. This being done, and the kingdom
        being left entirely without a head, Clovis proceeded to Cologne, the
        capital of Sighebert; he assembled the people, professed with much
        solemnity his horror of the tragedies that had taken place, and his
        complete innocence of all connection with them;<a id="noteref_500"
        name="noteref_500" href="#note_500"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">500</span></span></a> but
        suggested that, as they were now without a ruler, they should place
        themselves under his protection. The proposition was received with
        acclamation. The warriors elected him as their king, and thus, says
        the episcopal historian, <span class="tei tei-q">“Clovis received the
        treasures and dominions of Sighebert, and added them to his own.
        Every day God caused his enemies to fall beneath his hand, and
        enlarged his kingdom, because he walked with a right heart before the
        Lord, and did the things that were pleasing in His
        sight.”</span><a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href=
        "#note_501"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">501</span></span></a> His
        ambition was, however, still unsated. He proceeded, in a succession
        of expeditions, to unite the whole of Gaul under his sceptre,
        invading, defeating, capturing, and slaying the lawful sovereigns,
        who were for the most part his own relations. Having secured himself
        against dangers from without, by killing all his relations, with the
        exception of his wife and children, he is reported to have lamented
        before his courtiers his isolation, declaring that he had no
        relations remaining in the world to assist him in his adversity; but
        this speech, Gregory assures us, was a stratagem; for the king
        desired to discover whether any possible pretender to the throne had
        escaped his knowledge and his <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> sword. Soon after, he died, full of years and
        honours, and was buried in a cathedral which he had built.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having recounted
        all these things with unmoved composure, Gregory of Tours requests
        his reader to permit him to pause, to draw the moral of the history.
        It is the admirable manner in which Providence guides all things for
        the benefit of those whose opinions concerning the Trinity are
        strictly orthodox. Having briefly referred to Abraham, Jacob, Moses,
        Aaron, and David, all of whom are said to have intimated the correct
        doctrine on this subject, and all of whom were exceedingly
        prosperous, he passes to more modern times. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Arius, the impious founder of the impious sect, his
        entrails having fallen out, passed into the flames of hell; but
        Hilary, the blessed defender of the undivided Trinity, though exiled
        on that account, found his country in Paradise. The King Clovis, who
        confessed the Trinity, and by its assistance crushed the heretics,
        extended his dominions through all Gaul. Alaric, who denied the
        Trinity, was deprived of his kingdom and his subjects, and, what was
        far worse, was punished in the future world.”</span><a id=

        to cite other, though perhaps not quite such striking, instances of

        Questions of orthodoxy, or questions of fasting, appeared to the
        popular mind immeasurably more important than what <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> we should now call the fundamental
        principles of right and wrong. A law of Charlemagne, and also a law
        of the Saxons, condemned to death any one who ate meat in Lent,<a id=

        the priest was satisfied that it was a matter of absolute necessity.
        The moral enthusiasm of the age chiefly drove men to abandon their
        civic or domestic duties, to immure themselves in monasteries, and to
        waste their strength by prolonged and extravagant maceration.<a id=
        "noteref_505" name="noteref_505" href="#note_505"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">505</span></span></a> Yet, in
        the midst of all this superstition, there can be no question that in
        some respects the religious agencies were operating for good. The
        monastic bodies that everywhere arose, formed secure asylums for the
        multitudes who had been persecuted by their enemies, constituted an
        invaluable counterpoise to the rude military forces of the time,
        familiarised the imagination of men with religious types that could
        hardly fail in some degree to soften the character, and led the way
        in most forms of peaceful labour. When men, filled with admiration at
        the reports of the sanctity and the miracles of some illustrious
        saint, made pilgrimages to behold him, and found him attired in the
        rude garb of a peasant, with thick shoes, and with a scythe on his
        shoulder, superintending the labours of the farmers,<a id=
        "noteref_506" name="noteref_506" href="#note_506"><span class=

        whatever other benefit they might derive from the interview, they
        could scarcely fail to return with an increased sense of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the dignity of labour. It was probably at
        this time as much for the benefit of the world as of the Church, that
        the ecclesiastical sanctuaries and estates should remain inviolate,
        and the numerous legends of Divine punishment having overtaken those
        who transgressed them,<a id="noteref_508" name="noteref_508" href=
        "#note_508"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">508</span></span></a> attest
        the zeal with which the clergy sought to establish that
        inviolability. The great sanctity that was attached to holidays was
        also an important boon to the servile classes. The celebration of the
        first day of the week, in commemoration of the resurrection, and as a
        period of religious exercises, dates from the earliest age of the
        Church. The Christian festival was carefully distinguished from the
        Jewish Sabbath, with which it never appears to have been confounded
        till the close of the sixteenth century; but some Jewish converts,
        who considered the Jewish law to be still in force, observed both
        days. In general, however, the Christian festival alone was observed,
        and the Jewish Sabbatical obligation, as St. Paul most explicitly
        affirms, no longer rested upon the Christians. The grounds of the
        observance of Sunday were the manifest propriety and expediency of
        devoting a certain portion of time to devout exercises, the tradition
        which traced the sanctification of Sunday to apostolic times, and the
        right of the Church to appoint certain seasons to be kept holy by its
        members. When Christianity acquired an ascendancy in the Empire, its
        policy on this subject was manifested in one of the laws of
        Constantine, which, without making any direct reference to religious
        motives, ordered that, <span class="tei tei-q">“on the day of the
        sun,”</span> no servile work should be performed except <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> agriculture, which, being dependent on
        the weather, could not, it was thought, be reasonably postponed.
        Theodosius took a step further, and suppressed the public spectacles
        on that day. During the centuries that immediately followed the
        dissolution of the Roman Empire, the clergy devoted themselves with
        great and praiseworthy zeal to the suppression of labour both on
        Sundays and on the other leading Church holidays. More than one law
        was made, forbidding all Sunday labour, and this prohibition was
        reiterated by Charlemagne in his Capitularies.<a id="noteref_509"
        name="noteref_509" href="#note_509"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">510</span></span></a> and
        several legends were circulated, of men who had been afflicted
        miraculously with disease or with death, for having been guilty of
        this sin.<a id="noteref_511" name="noteref_511" href=

        Although the moral side of religion was greatly degraded or
        forgotten, there was, as I have already intimated, one important
        exception. Charity was so interwoven with the superstitious parts of
        ecclesiastical teaching, that it continued to grow and nourish in the
        darkest period. Of the acts of Queen Bathilda, it is said we know
        nothing except her donations to the monasteries, and the charity with
        which she purchased slaves and captives, and released them or
        converted them into monks.<a id="noteref_512" name="noteref_512"
        href="#note_512"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">512</span></span></a> While
        many of the bishops were men of gross and scandalous vice, there were
        always some who laboured assiduously in the old episcopal vocation of
        protecting the oppressed, interceding for the captives, and opening
        their sanctuaries to the fugitives. St. Germanus, a bishop of Paris,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a name="Pg246"
        id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> near the close of the sixth
        century, was especially famous for his zeal in ransoming
        captives.<a id="noteref_513" name="noteref_513" href=
        "#note_513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">513</span></span></a> The
        fame he acquired was so great, that prisoners are said to have called
        upon him to assist them, in the interval between his death and his
        burial; and the body of the saint becoming miraculously heavy, it was
        found impossible to carry it to the grave till the captives had been
        released.<a id="noteref_514" name="noteref_514" href=

        midst of the complete eclipse of all secular learning, in the midst
        of a reign of ignorance, imposture, and credulity which cannot be
        paralleled in history, there grew up a vast legendary literature,
        clustering around the form of the ascetic; and the lives of the
        saints, among very much that is grotesque, childish, and even
        immoral, contain some fragments of the purest and most touching

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the chief
        title of the period we are considering, to the indulgence of
        posterity, lies in its missionary labours. The stream of missionaries
        which had at first flowed from Palestine and Italy began to flow from
        the West. The Irish monasteries furnished the earliest, and probably
        the most numerous, labourers in the field. A great portion of the
        north of England was converted by the Irish monks of Lindisfarne. The
        fame of St. Columbanus in Gaul, in Germany, and in Italy, for a time
        even balanced that of St. Benedict himself, and the school which he
        founded at Luxeuil became the great seminary for mediæval
        missionaries, while <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg
        247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        monastery he planted at Bobbio continued to the present century. The
        Irish missionary, St. Gall, gave his name to a portion of Switzerland
        he had converted, and a crowd of other Irish missionaries penetrated
        to the remotest forests of Germany. The movement which began with St.
        Columba in the middle of the sixth century, was communicated to
        England and Gaul about a century later. Early in the eighth century
        it found a great leader in the Anglo-Saxon St. Boniface, who spread
        Christianity far and wide through Germany, and at once excited and
        disciplined an ardent enthusiasm, which appears to have attracted all
        that was morally best in the Church. During about three centuries,
        and while Europe had sunk into the most extreme moral, intellectual,
        and political degradation, a constant stream of missionaries poured
        forth from the monasteries, who spread the knowledge of the Cross and
        the seeds of a future civilisation through every land, from Lombardy
        to Sweden.<a id="noteref_516" name="noteref_516" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the whole,
        however, it would be difficult to exaggerate the superstition and the
        vice of the period between the dissolution of the Empire and the
        reign of Charlemagne. But in the midst of the chaos the elements of a
        new society may be detected, and we may already observe in embryo the
        movement which ultimately issued in the crusades, the feudal system,
        and chivalry. It is exclusively with the moral aspect of this
        movement that the present work is concerned, and I shall endeavour,
        in the remainder of this chapter, to describe and explain its
        incipient stages. It consisted of two parts—a fusion of Christianity
        with the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg
        248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        military spirit, and an increasing reverence for secular rank.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It had been an
        ancient maxim of the Greeks, that no more acceptable gifts can be
        offered in the temples of the gods, than the trophies won from an
        enemy in battle.<a id="noteref_517" name="noteref_517" href=
        "#note_517"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">517</span></span></a> Of this
        military religion Christianity had been at first the extreme
        negation. I have already had occasion to observe that it had been one
        of its earliest rules that no arms should be introduced within the
        church, and that soldiers returning even from the most righteous war
        should not be admitted to communion until after a period of penance
        and purification. A powerful party, which counted among its leaders
        Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen, Lactantius, and Basil,
        maintained that all warfare was unlawful for those who had been
        converted; and this opinion had its martyr in the celebrated
        Maximilianus, who suffered death under Diocletian solely because,
        having been enrolled as a soldier, he declared that he was a
        Christian, and that therefore he could not fight. The extent to which
        this doctrine was disseminated has been suggested with much
        plausibility as one of the causes of the Diocletian
        persecution.<a id="noteref_518" name="noteref_518" href=
        "#note_518"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">518</span></span></a> It was
        the subject of one of the reproaches of Celsus; and Origen, in reply,
        frankly accepted the accusation that Christianity was incompatible
        with military service, though he maintained that the prayers of the
        Christians were more efficacious than the swords of the
        legions.<a id="noteref_519" name="noteref_519" href=
        "#note_519"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">519</span></span></a> At the
        same time, there can be no question that many Christians, from a very
        early date, did enlist in the army, and that they were not cut off
        from the Church. The legend of the thundering legion, under Marcus
        Aurelius, whatever we may think of the pretended miracle, attested
        the fact, and it is expressly asserted by Tertullian.<a id=

        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249"
        id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> first fury of the Diocletian
        persecution fell upon Christian soldiers, and by the time of
        Constantine the army appears to have become, in a great degree,
        Christian. A Council of Arles, under Constantine, condemned soldiers
        who, through religious motives, deserted their colours; and St.
        Augustine threw his great influence into the same scale. But even
        where the calling was not regarded as sinful, it was strongly
        discouraged. The ideal or type of supreme excellence conceived by the
        imagination of the Pagan world and to which all their purest moral
        enthusiasm naturally aspired, was the patriot and soldier. The ideal
        of the Catholic legends was the ascetic, whose first duty was to
        abandon all secular feelings and ties. In most family circles the
        conflict between the two principles appeared, and in the moral
        atmosphere of the fourth and fifth centuries it was almost certain
        that every young man who was animated by any pure or genuine
        enthusiasm would turn from the army to the monks. St. Martin, St.
        Ferreol, St. Tarrachus, and St. Victricius, were among those who
        through religious motives abandoned the army.<a id="noteref_521"
        name="noteref_521" href="#note_521"><span class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">521</span></span></a> When
        Ulphilas translated the Bible into Gothic, he is said to have
        excepted the four books of Kings, through fear that they might
        encourage the martial disposition of the barbarians.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
        influence that contributed to bring the military profession into
        friendly connection with religion was the received doctrine
        concerning the Providential government of affairs. It was generally
        taught that all national catastrophes were penal inflictions,
        resulting, for the most part, from the vices or the religious errors
        of the leading men, and that temporal prosperity was the reward of
        orthodoxy and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg
        250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        virtue. A great battle, on the issue of which the fortunes of a
        people or of a monarch depended, was therefore supposed to be the
        special occasion of Providential interposition, and the hope of
        obtaining military success became one of the most frequent motives of
        conversion. The conversion of Constantine was professedly, and the
        conversion of Clovis was perhaps really, due to the persuasion that
        the Divine interposition had in a critical moment given them the
        victory; and I have already noticed how large a part must be assigned
        to this order of ideas in facilitating the progress of Christianity
        among the barbarians. When a cross was said to have appeared
        miraculously to Constantine, with an inscription announcing the
        victory of the Milvian bridge; when the same holy sign, adorned with
        the sacred monogram, was carried in the forefront of the Roman
        armies; when the nails of the cross, which Helena had brought from
        Jerusalem, were converted by the emperor into a helmet, and into bits
        for his war-horse, it was evident that a great change was passing
        over the once pacific spirit of the Church.<a id="noteref_523" name=
        "noteref_523" href="#note_523"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">523</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many circumstances
        conspired to accelerate it. Northern tribes, who had been taught that
        the gates of the Walhalla were ever open to the warrior who presented
        himself stained with the blood of his vanquished enemies, were
        converted to Christianity; but they carried their old feelings into
        their new creed. The conflict of many races, and the paralysis of all
        government that followed the fall of the Empire, made force
        everywhere dominant, and petty wars incessant. The military
        obligations attached to the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“benefices”</span> which the sovereigns gave to their
        leading chiefs, connected the idea of military service with that of
        rank still more closely than it had been connected before, and
        rendered it doubly honourable <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> in the eyes of men. Many bishops and abbots,
        partly from the turbulence of their times and characters, and partly,
        at a later period, from their position as great feudal lords, were
        accustomed to lead their followers in battle; and this custom, though
        prohibited by Charlemagne, may be traced to so late a period as the
        battle of Agincourt.<a id="noteref_524" name="noteref_524" href=
        "#note_524"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The stigma which
        Christianity had attached to war was thus gradually effaced. At the
        same time, the Church remained, on the whole, a pacific influence.
        War was rather condoned than consecrated, and, whatever might be the
        case with a few isolated prelates, the Church did nothing to increase
        or encourage it. The transition from the almost Quaker tenets of the
        primitive Church to the essentially military Christianity of the
        Crusades was chiefly due to another cause—to the terrors and to the
        example of Mohammedanism.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This great
        religion, which so long rivalled the influence of Christianity, had
        indeed spread the deepest and most justifiable panic through
        Christendom. Without any of those aids to the imagination which
        pictures and images can furnish, without any elaborate sacerdotal
        organisation, preaching the purest Monotheism among ignorant and
        barbarous men, and inculcating, on the whole, an extremely high and
        noble system of morals, it spread with a rapidity and it acquired a
        hold over the minds of its votaries, which it is probable that no
        other religion has altogether equalled. It borrowed from Christianity
        that doctrine of salvation by belief, which is perhaps the most
        powerful impulse that can be applied to the characters of masses of
        men, and it elaborated so minutely the charms of its sensual heaven,
        and the terrors of its material hell, as to cause the alternative to
        appeal with unrivalled force to the gross imaginations of the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252"
        id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> people. It possessed a book
        which, however inferior to that of the opposing religion, has
        nevertheless been the consolation and the support of millions in many
        ages. It taught a fatalism which in its first age nerved its
        adherents with a matchless military courage, and which, though in
        later days it has often paralysed their active energies, has also
        rarely failed to support them under the pressure of inevitable
        calamity. But, above all, it discovered the great, the fatal secret
        of uniting indissolubly the passion of the soldier with the passion
        of the devotee. Making the conquest of the infidel the first of
        duties, and proposing heaven as the certain reward of the valiant
        soldier, it created a blended enthusiasm that soon overpowered the
        divided counsels and the voluptuous governments of the East, and,
        within a century of the death of Mohammed, his followers had almost
        extirpated Christianity from its original home, founded great
        monarchies in Asia and Africa, planted a noble, though transient and
        exotic, civilisation in Spain, menaced the capital of the Eastern
        empire, and, but for the issue of a single battle, they would
        probably have extended their sceptre over the energetic and
        progressive races of Central Europe. The wave was broken by Charles
        Martel, at the battle of Poitiers, and it is now useless to speculate
        what might have been the consequences had Mohammedanism unfurled its
        triumphant banner among those Teutonic tribes who have so often
        changed their creed, and on whom the course of civilisation has so
        largely depended. But one great change was in fact achieved. The
        spirit of Mohammedanism slowly passed into Christianity, and
        transformed it into its image. The spectacle of an essentially
        military religion fascinated men who were at once very warlike and
        very superstitious. The panic that had palsied Europe was after a
        long interval succeeded by a fierce reaction of resentment. Pride and
        religion conspired to urge the Christian warriors against those who
        had so often defeated the armies and wasted the territory of
        Christendom, who had shorn the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> empire of the Cross of many of its fairest
        provinces, and profaned that holy city which was venerated not only
        for its past associations, but also for the spiritual blessings it
        could still bestow upon the pilgrim. The papal indulgences proved not
        less efficacious in stimulating the military spirit than the promises
        of Mohammed, and for about two centuries every pulpit in Christendom
        proclaimed the duty of war with the unbeliever, and represented the
        battle-field as the sure path to heaven. The religious orders which
        arose united the character of the priest with that of the warrior,
        and when, at the hour of sunset, the soldier knelt down to pray
        before his cross, that cross was the handle of his sword.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be
        impossible to conceive a more complete transformation than
        Christianity had thus undergone, and it is melancholy to contrast
        with its aspect during the crusades the impression it had once most
        justly made upon the world, as the spirit of gentleness and of peace
        encountering the spirit of violence and war. Among the many curious
        habits of the Pagan Irish, one of the most significant was that of
        perpendicular burial. With a feeling something like that which
        induced Vespasian to declare that a Roman emperor should die
        standing, the Pagan warriors shrank from the notion of being
        prostrate even in death, and they appear to have regarded this
        martial burial as a special symbol of Paganism. An old Irish
        manuscript tells how, when Christianity had been introduced into
        Ireland, a king of Ulster on his deathbed charged his son never to
        become a Christian, but to be buried standing upright like a man in
        battle, with his face for ever turned to the south, defying the men
        of Leinster.<a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525" href=
        "#note_525"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">525</span></span></a> As late
        as the sixteenth century, it is said that in some parts of Ireland
        children were baptised by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg
        254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        immersion; but the right arms of the males were carefully held above
        the water, in order that, not having been dipped in the sacred
        stream, they might strike the more deadly blow.<a id="noteref_526"
        name="noteref_526" href="#note_526"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It had been boldly
        predicted by some of the early Christians that the conversion of the
        world would lead to the establishment of perpetual peace. In looking
        back, with our present experience, we are driven to the melancholy
        conclusion that, instead of diminishing the number of wars,
        ecclesiastical influence has actually and very seriously increased
        it. We may look in vain for any period since Constantine, in which
        the clergy, as a body, exerted themselves to repress the military
        spirit, or to prevent or abridge a particular war, with an energy at
        all comparable to that which they displayed in stimulating the
        fanaticism of the crusaders, in producing the atrocious massacre of
        the Albigenses, in embittering the religious contests that followed
        the Reformation. Private wars were, no doubt, in some degree
        repressed by their influence; for the institution of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Truce of God”</span> was for a time of much value, and
        when, towards the close of the middle ages, the custom of duels
        arose, it was strenuously condemned by the clergy; but we can hardly
        place any great value on their exertions in this field, when we
        remember that duels were almost or altogether unknown to the Pagan
        world; that, having arisen in a period of great superstition, the
        anathemas of the Church were almost impotent to discourage them; and
        that in our own century they are rapidly disappearing before the
        simple censure of an industrial society. It is possible—though it
        would, I imagine, be difficult to prove it—that the mediatorial
        office, so often exercised by bishops, may sometimes have prevented
        wars; and it is certain that during the period of the religious wars,
        so much military spirit existed in Europe that it must necessarily
        have found a vent, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg
        255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        under no circumstances could the period have been one of perfect
        peace. But when all these qualifications have been fully admitted,
        the broad fact will remain, that, with the exception of
        Mohammedanism, no other religion has done so much to produce war as
        was done by the religious teachers of Christendom during several
        centuries. The military fanaticism evoked by the indulgences of the
        popes, by the exhortations of the pulpit, by the religious importance
        attached to the relics at Jerusalem, and by the prevailing hatred of
        misbelievers, has scarcely ever been equalled in its intensity, and
        it has caused the effusion of oceans of blood, and has been
        productive of incalculable misery to the world. Religious fanaticism
        was a main cause of the earlier wars, and an important ingredient in
        the later ones. The peace principles, that were so common before
        Constantine, have found scarcely any echo except from Erasmus, the
        Anabaptists, and the Quakers;<a id="noteref_527" name="noteref_527"
        href="#note_527"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">527</span></span></a> and
        although some very important pacific agencies have arisen out of the
        industrial progress of modern times, these have been, for the most
        part, wholly unconnected with, and have in some cases been directly
        opposed to, theological interests.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But although
        theological influences cannot reasonably be said to have diminished
        the number of wars, they have had a very real and beneficial effect
        in diminishing their atrocity. On few subjects have the moral
        opinions of different ages exhibited so marked a variation as in
        their judgments of what punishment may justly be imposed on a
        conquered enemy, and these variations have often been cited as an
        argument against those who believe in the existence of natural moral
        perceptions. To those, however, who accept <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> that doctrine, with the limitations that have
        been stated in the first chapter, they can cause no perplexity. In
        the first dawning of the human intelligence (as I have said) the
        notion of duty, as distinguished from that of interest, appears, and
        the mind, in reviewing the various emotions by which it is
        influenced, recognises the unselfish and benevolent motives as
        essentially and generically superior to the selfish and the cruel.
        But it is the general condition of society alone that determines the
        standard of benevolence—the classes towards which every good man will
        exercise it. At first, the range of duty is the family, the tribe,
        the state, the confederation. Within these limits every man feels
        himself under moral obligations to those about him; but he regards
        the outer world as we regard wild animals, as beings upon whom he may
        justifiably prey. Hence, we may explain the curious fact that the
        terms brigand or corsair conveyed in the early stages of society no

        men were looked upon simply as we look upon huntsmen, and if they
        displayed courage and skill in their pursuit, they were deemed fit
        subjects for admiration. Even in the writings of the most enlightened
        philosophers of Greece, war with barbarians is represented as a form
        of chase, and the simple desire of obtaining the barbarians as slaves
        was considered a sufficient reason for invading them. The right of
        the conqueror to kill his captives <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class=

        restricted by any considerations of age or sex. Several instances are
        recorded of Greek and other cities being deliberately destroyed by
        Greeks or by Romans, and the entire populations ruthlessly
        massacred.<a id="noteref_529" name="noteref_529" href=

        whole career of the early republic of Rome, though much idealised and
        transfigured by later historians, was probably governed by these
        principles.<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href=

        normal fate of the captive, which, among barbarians, had been death,
        was, in civilised antiquity, slavery; but many thousands were
        condemned to the gladiatorial shows, and the vanquished general was
        commonly slain in the Mamertine prison, while his conqueror ascended
        in triumph to the Capitol.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few traces of a
        more humane spirit may, it is true, be discovered. Plato had
        advocated the liberation of all Greek prisoners upon payment of a
        fixed ransom,<a id="noteref_531" name="noteref_531" href=
        "#note_531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        example never appears to have been generally followed. In Rome, the
        notion of international obligation was <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> very strongly felt. No war was considered just
        which had not been officially declared; and even in the case of wars
        with barbarians, the Roman historians often discuss the sufficiency
        or insufficiency of the motives, with a conscientious severity a
        modern historian could hardly surpass.<a id="noteref_533" name=
        "noteref_533" href="#note_533"><span class=

        later Greek and Latin writings occasionally contain maxims which
        exhibit a considerable progress in this sphere. The sole legitimate
        object of war, both Cicero and Sallust declared to be an assured
        peace. That war, according to Tacitus, ends well which ends with a
        pardon. Pliny refused to apply the epithet great to Cæsar, on account
        of the torrents of human blood he had shed. Two Roman
        conquerors<a id="noteref_534" name="noteref_534" href=
        "#note_534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        credited with the saying that it is better to save the life of one
        citizen than to destroy a thousand enemies. Marcus Aurelius
        mournfully assimilated the career of a conqueror to that of a simple
        robber. Nations or armies which voluntarily submitted to Rome were
        habitually treated with great leniency, and numerous acts of
        individual magnanimity are recorded. The violation of the chastity of
        conquered women by soldiers in a siege was denounced as a rare and
        atrocious crime.<a id="noteref_535" name="noteref_535" href=

        extreme atrocities of ancient war appear at last to have been

        where Roman ambassadors had been insulted, or where some special act
        of ill faith or cruelty had taken place, were razed to the ground,
        and their populations massacred or delivered into slavery. Barbarian
        prisoners were regarded almost as wild beasts, and sent in thousands
        to fill the slave market or to combat in the arena.</p><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The changes
        Christianity effected in the rights of war were very important, and
        they may, I think, be comprised under three heads. In the first
        place, it suppressed the gladiatorial shows, and thereby saved
        thousands of captives from a bloody death. In the next place, it
        steadily discouraged the practice of enslaving prisoners, ransomed
        immense multitudes with charitable contributions, and by slow and
        insensible gradations proceeded on its path of mercy till it became a
        recognised principle of international law, that no Christian
        prisoners should be reduced to slavery.<a id="noteref_537" name=
        "noteref_537" href="#note_537"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">537</span></span></a> In the
        third place, it had a more indirect but very powerful influence by
        the creation of a new warlike ideal. The ideal knight of the Crusades
        and of chivalry, uniting all the force and fire of the ancient
        warrior, with something of the tenderness and humility of the
        Christian saint, sprang from the conjunction of the two streams of
        religious and of military <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
        260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        feeling; and although this ideal, like all others, was a creation of
        the imagination not often perfectly realised in life, yet it remained
        the type and model of warlike excellence, to which many generations
        aspired; and its softening influence may even now be largely traced
        in the character of the modern gentleman.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Together with the
        gradual fusion of the military spirit with Christianity, we may dimly
        descry, in the period before Charlemagne, the first stages of that
        consecration of secular rank which at a later period, in the forms of
        chivalry, the divine right of kings, and the reverence for
        aristocracies, played so large a part both in moral and in political
        history.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have already
        seen that the course of events in the Roman Empire had been towards
        the continual aggrandisement of the imperial power. The
        representative despotism of Augustus was at last succeeded by the
        oriental despotism of Diocletian. The senate sank into a powerless
        assembly of imperial nominees, and the spirit of Roman freedom wholly
        perished with the extinction of Stoicism.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would probably
        be a needless refinement to seek any deeper causes for this change
        than may be found in the ordinary principles of human nature.
        Despotism is the normal and legitimate government of an early society
        in which knowledge has not yet developed the powers of the people;
        but when it is introduced into a civilised community, it is of the
        nature of a disease, and a disease which, unless it be checked, has a
        continual tendency to spread. When free nations abdicate their
        political functions, they gradually lose both the capacity and the
        desire for freedom. Political talent and ambition, having no sphere
        for action, steadily decay, and servile, enervating, and vicious
        habits proportionately increase. Nations are organic beings in a
        constant process of expansion or decay, and where they do not exhibit
        a progress of liberty they usually exhibit a progress of
        servitude.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It can hardly be
        asserted that Christianity had much influence <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> upon this change. By accelerating in some
        degree that withdrawal of the virtuous energies of the people from
        the sphere of government which had long been in process, it prevented
        the great improvement of morals, which it undoubtedly effected, from
        appearing perceptibly in public affairs. It taught a doctrine of
        passive obedience, which its disciples nobly observed in the worst
        periods of persecution. On the other hand, the Christians
        emphatically repudiated the ascription of Divine honours to the
        sovereign, and they asserted with heroic constancy their independent
        worship, in defiance of the law. After the time of Constantine,
        however, their zeal became far less pure, and sectarian interests
        wholly governed their principles. Much misapplied learning has been
        employed in endeavouring to extract from the Fathers a consistent
        doctrine concerning the relations of subjects to their sovereigns;
        but every impartial observer may discover that the principle upon
        which they acted was exceedingly simple. When a sovereign was
        sufficiently orthodox in his opinions, and sufficiently zealous in
        patronising the Church and in persecuting the heretics, he was
        extolled as an angel. When his policy was opposed to the Church, he
        was represented as a dæmon. The estimate which Gregory of Tours has
        given of the character of Clovis, though far more frank, is not a
        more striking instance of moral perversion than the fulsome and
        indeed blasphemous adulation which Eusebius poured upon Constantine—a
        sovereign whose character was at all times of the most mingled
        description, and who, shortly after his conversion, put to a violent
        death his son, his nephew, and his wife. If we were to estimate the
        attitude of ecclesiastics to sovereigns by the language of Eusebius,
        we should suppose that they ascribed to them a direct Divine
        inspiration, and exalted the Imperial dignity to an extent that was
        before unknown.<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href=
        "#note_538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        when Julian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg
        262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        mounted the throne, the whole aspect of the Church was changed. This
        great and virtuous, though misguided sovereign, whose private life
        was a model of purity, who carried to the throne the manners, tastes,
        and friendships of a philosophic life, and who proclaimed and, with
        very slight exceptions, acted with the largest and most generous
        toleration, was an enemy of the Church, and all the vocabulary of
        invective was in consequence habitually lavished upon him.
        Ecclesiastics and laymen combined in insulting him, and when, after a
        brief but glorious reign of less than two years, he met an honourable
        death on the battle-field, neither the disaster that had befallen the
        Roman arms, nor the present dangers of the army, nor the heroic
        courage which the fallen emperor had displayed, nor the majestic
        tranquillity of his end, nor the tears of his faithful friends, could
        shame the Christian community into the decency of silence. A peal of
        brutal merriment filled the land. In Antioch the Christians assembled
        in the theatres and in the churches, to celebrate with rejoicing the
        death which their emperor had met in fighting against the enemies of
        his country.<a id="noteref_539" name="noteref_539" href=
        "#note_539"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        Gregory Nazianzen devoted his eloquence to immortalising it. His
        brother had at one time been a high official in the Empire, and had
        fearlessly owned his Christianity under Julian; but that emperor not
        only did not remove him from his post, but even honoured him with his
        warm friendship.<a id="noteref_541" name="noteref_541" href=
        "#note_541"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a> The
        body of Julian had been laid but a short time in the grave, when St.
        Gregory delivered two fierce invectives against his memory, collected
        the grotesque calumnies that had been heaped upon his character,
        expressed a regret that his remains had not been flung after death
        into the common sewer, and regaled the hearers by an <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> emphatic assertion of the tortures that
        were awaiting him in hell. Among the Pagans a charge of the gravest
        kind was brought against the Christians. It was said that Julian died
        by the spear, not of an enemy, but of one of his own Christian
        soldiers. When we remember that he was at once an emperor and a
        general, that he fell when bravely and confidently leading his army
        in the field, and in the critical moment of a battle on which the
        fortunes of the Empire largely depended, this charge, which Libanius
        has made, appears to involve as large an amount of base treachery as
        any that can be conceived. It was probably a perfectly groundless
        calumny; but the manner in which it was regarded among the Christians
        is singularly characteristic. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Libanius,”</span> says one of the ecclesiastical
        historians, <span class="tei tei-q">“clearly states that the emperor
        fell by the hand of a Christian; and this, probably, was the truth.
        It is not unlikely that some of the soldiers who then served in the
        Roman army might have conceived the idea of acting like the ancient
        slayers of tyrants who exposed themselves to death in the cause of
        liberty, and fought in defence of their country, their families, and
        their friends, and whose names are held in universal admiration.
        Still less is he deserving of blame who, for the sake of God and of
        religion, performed so bold a deed.”</span><a id="noteref_542" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be
        asserted, I think, without exaggeration, that the complete
        subordination of all other principles to their theological interests,
        which characterised the ecclesiastics under Julian, continued for
        many centuries. No language of invective was too extreme to be
        applied to a sovereign who opposed their interests. No language of
        adulation was too extravagant for a sovereign who sustained them. Of
        all the emperors who disgraced the throne of Constantinople, the most
        odious and ferocious was probably Phocas. An obscure centurion, he
        rose by a military revolt to the supreme power, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and the Emperor Maurice, with his family,
        fell into his hands. He resolved to put the captive emperor to death;
        but, first of all, he ordered his five children to be brought out and
        to be successively murdered before the eyes of their father, who bore
        the awful sight with a fine mixture of antique heroism and of
        Christian piety, murmuring, as each child fell beneath the knife of
        the assassin, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art just, O Lord, and
        righteous are Thy judgments,”</span> and even interposing, at the
        last moment, to reveal the heroic fraud of the nurse who desired to
        save his youngest child by substituting for it her own. But
        Maurice—who had been a weak and avaricious rather than a vicious
        sovereign—had shown himself jealous of the influence of the Pope, had
        forbidden the soldiers, during the extreme danger of their country,
        deserting their colours to enrol themselves as monks, and had even
        encouraged the pretensions of the Archbishop of Constantinople to the
        title of Universal Bishop; and, in the eyes of the Roman priests, the
        recollection of these crimes was sufficient to excuse the most brutal
        of murders. In two letters, full of passages from Scripture, and
        replete with fulsome and blasphemous flattery, the Pope, St. Gregory
        the Great, wrote to congratulate Phocas and his wife upon their
        triumph; he called heaven and earth to rejoice over them; he placed
        their images to be venerated in the Lateran, and he adroitly
        insinuated that it was impossible that, with their well-known piety,
        they could fail to be very favourable to the See of Peter.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The course of
        events in relation to the monarchical power was for some time
        different in the East and the West. Constantine had himself assumed
        more of the pomp and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg
        265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        manner of an oriental sovereign than any preceding emperor, and the
        court of Constantinople was soon characterised by an extravagance of
        magnificence on the part of the monarch, and of adulation on the part
        of the subjects, which has probably never been exceeded.<a id=
        "noteref_544" name="noteref_544" href="#note_544"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">544</span></span></a> The
        imperial power in the East overshadowed the ecclesiastical, and the
        priests, notwithstanding their fierce outbreak during the
        iconoclastic controversy, and a few minor paroxysms of revolt,
        gradually sank into that contented subservience which has usually
        characterised the Eastern Church. In the West, however, the Roman
        bishops were in a great degree independent of the sovereigns, and in
        some degree opposed to their interests. The transfer of the imperial
        power to Constantinople, by leaving the Roman bishops the chief
        personages in a city which long association as well as actual power
        rendered the foremost in the world, was one of the great causes of
        the aggrandisement of the Papacy and the Arianism of many sovereigns,
        the jealousy which others exhibited of ecclesiastical encroachments,
        and the lukewarmness of a few in persecuting heretics, were all
        causes of dissension. On the severance of the Empire, the Western
        Church came in contact with rulers of another type. The barbarian
        kings were little more than military chiefs, elected for the most
        part by the people, surrounded by little or no special sanctity, and
        maintaining their precarious and very restricted authority by their
        courage or their skill. A few feebly imitated the pomp of the Roman
        emperors, but their claims had no great weight with the world. The
        aureole which the genius of Theodoric cast around his throne passed
        away upon his death, and the Arianism of that great sovereign
        sufficiently debarred him from the sympathies of the Church. In Gaul,
        under a few bold and unscrupulous men, the Merovingian dynasty
        emerged from a host of petty kings, and consolidated the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> whole country into one kingdom; but after
        a short period it degenerated, the kings became mere puppets in the
        hands of the mayors of the palace, and these latter, whose office had
        become hereditary, who were the chiefs of the great landed
        proprietors, and who had acquired by their position a personal
        ascendancy over the sovereigns, became the virtual rulers of the
        nation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was out of
        these somewhat unpromising conditions that the mediæval doctrine of
        the Divine right of kings, and the general reverence for rank, that
        formed the essence of chivalry, were slowly evolved. Political and
        moral causes conspired in producing them. The chief political
        causes—which are well known—may be summed up in a few words.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Leo the
        Isaurian attempted, in the eighth century, to repress the worship of
        images, the resistance which he met at Constantinople, though
        violent, was speedily allayed; but the Pope, assuming a far higher
        position than any Byzantine ecclesiastic could attain, boldly
        excommunicated the emperor, and led a revolt against his authority,
        which resulted in the virtual independence of Italy. His position was
        at this time singularly grand. He represented a religious cause to
        which the great mass of the Christian world were passionately
        attached. He was venerated as the emancipator of Italy. He exhibited
        in the hour of his triumph a moderation which conciliated many
        enemies, and prevented the anarchy that might naturally have been
        expected. He presided, at the same time, over a vast monastic
        organisation, which ramified over all Christendom, propagated his
        authority among many barbarous nations, and, by its special
        attachment to the Papacy, as distinguished from the Episcopacy,
        contributed very much to transform Christianity into a spiritual
        despotism. One great danger, however, still menaced his power. The
        barbarous Lombards were continually invading his territory, and
        threatening the independence of Rome. The Lombard monarch, Luitprand
        had quailed in the very <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg
        267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        hour of his triumph before the menace of eternal torture but his
        successor, Astolphus, was proof against every fear, and it seemed as
        though the Papal city must have inevitably succumbed before his
        arms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In their complete
        military impotence, the Popes looked abroad for some foreign succour,
        and they naturally turned to the Franks, whose martial tastes and
        triumphs were universally renowned. Charles Martel, though simply a
        mayor of the palace, had saved Europe from the Mohammedans, and the
        Pope expected that he would unsheath his sword for the defence of the
        Vatican. Charles, however, was deaf to all entreaties; and, although
        he had done more than any ruler since Constantine for the Church, his
        attention seems to have been engrossed by the interests of his own
        country, and he was much alienated from the sympathies of the clergy.
        An ancient legend tells how a saint saw his soul carried by dæmons
        into hell, because he had secularised Church property, and a more
        modern historian<a id="noteref_545" name="noteref_545" href=
        "#note_545"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">545</span></span></a> has
        ascribed his death to his having hesitated to defend the Pope. His
        son, Pepin, however, actuated probably in different degrees by
        personal ambition, a desire for military adventure, and religious
        zeal, listened readily to the prayer of the Pope, and a compact was
        entered into between the parties, which proved one of the most
        important events in history. Pepin agreed to secure the Pope from the
        danger by which he was threatened. The Pope agreed to give his
        religious sanction to the ambition of Pepin, who designed to depose
        the Merovingian dynasty, and to become in name, as he was already in
        fact, the sovereign of Gaul.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
        necessary for me to recount at length the details of these
        negotiations, which are described by many historians. It is
        sufficient to say, that the compact was religiously observed. Pepin
        made two expeditions to Italy, and completely <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> shattered the power of the Lombards,
        wresting from them the rich exarchate of Ravenna, which he ceded to
        the Pope, who still retained his nominal allegiance to the Byzantine
        emperor, but who became, by this donation, for the first time
        avowedly an independent temporal prince. On the other hand, the
        deposition of Childeric was peaceably effected; the last of the
        Merovingians was immured in a monastery, and the Carlovingian dynasty
        ascended the throne under the special benediction of the Pope, who
        performed on the occasion the ceremony of consecration, which had not
        previously been in general use,<a id="noteref_546" name="noteref_546"
        href="#note_546"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">546</span></span></a> placed
        the crown with his own hands on the head of Pepin, and delivered a
        solemn anathema against all who should rebel against the new king or
        against his successors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The extreme
        importance of these events was probably not fully realised by any of
        the parties concerned in them. It was evident, indeed, that the Pope
        had been freed from a pressing danger, and had acquired a great
        accession of temporal power, and also that a new dynasty had arisen
        in Gaul under circumstances that were singularly favourable and
        imposing. But, much more important than these facts was the permanent
        consecration of the royal authority that had been effected. The Pope
        had successfully asserted his power of deposing and elevating kings,
        and had thus acquired a position which influenced the whole
        subsequent course of European history. The monarch, if he had become
        in some degree subservient to the priest, had become in a great
        degree independent of his people; the Divine origin of his power was
        regarded as a dogma of religion, and a sanctity surrounded him which
        immeasurably aggrandised his power. The ascription, by the Pagans, of
        divinity to kings had had no appreciable effect in increasing their
        authority or restraining the limits of criticism or of rebellion. The
        ascription of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg
        269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a
        Divine right to kings, independent of the wishes of the people, has
        been one of the most enduring and most potent of superstitions, and
        it has even now not wholly vanished from the world.<a id=
        "noteref_547" name="noteref_547" href="#note_547"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">547</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mere isolated
        political events have, however, rarely or never this profound
        influence, unless they have been preceded and prepared by other
        agencies. The first predisposing cause of the ready reception of the
        doctrine of the Divine character of authority, may probably be found
        in the prominence of the monastic system. I have already observed
        that this system represents in its extreme form that exaltation of
        the virtues of humility and of obedience which so broadly
        distinguishes the Christian from the Pagan type of excellence. I have
        also noticed that, owing to the concurrence of many causes, it had
        acquired such dimensions and influence as to supply the guiding ideal
        of the Christian world. Controlling or monopolising all education and
        literature, furnishing most of the legislators and many of the
        statesmen of the age, attracting to themselves all moral enthusiasm
        and most intellectual ability, the monks soon left their impress on
        the character of nations. Habits of obedience and dispositions of
        humility were diffused, revered, and idealised, and a Church which
        rested mainly on tradition fostered a deep sense of the sanctity of
        antiquity, and a natural disposition to observe traditional customs.
        In this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name=
        "Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> manner a tone of
        feeling was gradually formed that assimilated with the monarchical
        and aristocratical institutions of feudalism, which flourished
        chiefly because they corresponded with the moral feelings of the
        time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the next place,
        a series of social and political causes diminished the personal
        independence for which the barbarians had been noted. The king had at
        first been, not the sovereign of a country, but the chief of a
        tribe.<a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href=
        "#note_548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">548</span></span></a>
        Gradually, however, with more settled habits, the sovereignty assumed
        a territorial character, and we may soon discover the rudiments of a
        territorial aristocracy. The kings gave their leading chiefs portions
        of conquered land or of the royal domains, under the name of
        benefices. The obligation of military service was attached to these
        benefices, and by slow and perhaps insensible stages, each of which
        has been the subject of fierce controversy, they were made
        irrevocable, and ultimately hereditary. While society was still
        disorganised, small landlords purchased the protection of the Church,
        or of some important chief, by surrendering their estates, which they
        received back as tenants, subject to the condition of the payment of
        rent, or of military service. Others, without making such surrender,
        placed themselves under the care of a neighbouring lord, and offered,
        in return, homage or military aid. At the same time, through causes
        to which I have already adverted, the free peasants for the most part
        sank into serfs, subject to and protected by the landowners. In this
        manner a hierarchy of ranks was gradually formed, of which the
        sovereign was the apex and the serf the basis. The complete legal
        organisation of this hierarchy belongs to <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the period of feudalism, which is not within
        the scope of the present volume; but the chief elements of feudalism
        existed before Charlemagne, and the moral results flowing from them
        may be already discerned. Each rank, except the very highest, was
        continually brought into contact with a superior, and a feeling of
        constant dependence and subordination was accordingly fostered. To
        the serf, who depended for all things upon the neighbouring noble, to
        the noble, who held all his dignities on the condition of frequent
        military service under his sovereign, the idea of secular rank became
        indissolubly connected with that of supreme greatness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will appear
        evident, from the foregoing observations, that in the period before
        Charlemagne the moral and political causes were already in action,
        which at a much later period produced the organisation of chivalry—an
        organisation which was founded on the combination and the
        glorification of secular rank and military prowess. But, in order
        that the tendencies I have described should acquire their full force,
        it was necessary that they should be represented or illustrated in
        some great personage, who, by the splendour and the beauty of his
        career, could fascinate the imaginations of men. It is much easier to
        govern great masses of men through their imagination than through
        their reason. Moral principles rarely act powerfully upon the world,
        except by way of example or ideals. When the course of events has
        been to glorify the ascetic or monarchical or military spirit, a
        great saint, or sovereign, or soldier will arise, who will
        concentrate in one dazzling focus the blind tendencies of his time,
        kindle the enthusiasm and fascinate the imagination of the people.
        But for the prevailing tendency, the great man would not have arisen,
        or would not have exercised his great influence. But for the great
        man, whose career appealed vividly to the imagination, the prevailing
        tendency would never have acquired its full intensity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This typical
        figure appeared in Charlemagne, whose <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> colossal form towers with a majestic grandeur
        both in history and in romance. Of all the great rulers of men, there
        has probably been no other who was so truly many-sided, whose
        influence pervaded so completely all the religious, intellectual, and
        political modes of thought existing in his time. Rising in one of the
        darkest periods of European history, this great emperor resuscitated,
        with a brief but dazzling splendour, the faded glories of the Empire
        of the West, conducted, for the most part in person, numerous
        expeditions against the barbarous nations around him, promulgated a
        vast system of legislation, reformed the discipline of every order of
        the Church, and reduced all classes of the clergy to subservience to
        his will, while, by legalising tithes, he greatly increased their
        material prosperity. He at the same time contributed, in a measure,
        to check the intellectual decadence by founding schools and
        libraries, and drawing around him all the scattered learning of
        Europe. He reformed the coinage, extended commerce, influenced
        religious controversies, and convoked great legislative assemblies,
        which ultimately contributed largely to the organisation of
        feudalism. In all these spheres the traces of his vast, organising,
        and far-seeing genius may be detected, and the influence which he
        exercised over the imaginations of men is shown by the numerous
        legends of which he is the hero. In the preceding ages the supreme
        ideal had been the ascetic. When the popular imagination embodied in
        legends its conception of humanity in its noblest and most attractive
        form, it instinctively painted some hermit-saint of many penances and
        many miracles. In the Romances of Charlemagne and of Arthur we may
        trace the dawning of a new type of greatness. The hero of the
        imagination of Europe was no longer a hermit, but a king, a warrior,
        a knight. The long train of influences I have reviewed, culminating
        in Charlemagne, had done their work. The age of the ascetics began to
        fade. The age of the crusades and of chivalry succeeded
        it.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name=
        "Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is curious to
        observe the manner in which, under the influence of the prevailing
        tendency, the career of Charlemagne was transfigured by the popular
        imagination. His military enterprises had been chiefly directed
        against the Saxons, against whom he had made not less than thirty-two
        expeditions. With the Mohammedans he had but little contact. It was
        Charles Martel, not his grandson, who, by the great battle of
        Poitiers, had checked their career. Charlemagne made, in person, but
        a single expedition against them in Spain, and that expedition was on
        a small scale, and was disastrous in its issue. But in the
        Carlovingian romances, which arose at a time when the enthusiasm of
        the Crusades was permeating Christendom, events were represented in a
        wholly different light. Charles Martel has no place among the ideal
        combatants of the Church. He had appeared too early, his figure was
        not sufficiently great to fascinate the popular imagination, and by
        confiscating ecclesiastical property, and refusing to assist the Pope
        against the Lombards, he had fallen under the ban of the clergy.
        Charlemagne, on the other hand, was represented as the first and
        greatest of the crusaders. His wars with the Saxons were scarcely
        noticed. His whole life was said to have been spent in heroic and
        triumphant combats with the followers of Mohammed.<a id="noteref_549"
        name="noteref_549" href="#note_549"><span class=

        the achievements attributed to him was an expedition to rescue Nismes
        and Carcassonne from their grasp, which was, in fact, a dim tradition
        of the victories of Charles Martel.<a id="noteref_550" name=

        even said to have carried his victorious arms into the heart of
        Palestine, and he is the hero of what are probably the three earliest
        extant romances of the Crusades.<a id="noteref_551" name=

        the middle ages from the age of military Christianity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the verge of
        this great change I draw this history to a close. In pursuing our
        long and chequered course, from Augustus to Charlemagne, we have seen
        the rise and fall of many types of character, and of many forms of
        enthusiasm. We have seen the influence of universal empire expanding,
        and the influence of Greek civilisation intensifying, the sympathies
        of Europe. We have surveyed the successive progress of Stoicism,
        Platonism, and Egyptian philosophies, at once reflecting and guiding
        the moral tendencies of society. We have traced the course of
        progress or retrogression in many fields of social, political, and
        legislative life, have watched the cradle of European Christianity,
        examined the causes of its triumph, the difficulties it encountered,
        and the priceless blessings its philanthropic spirit bestowed upon
        mankind. We have also pursued step by step the mournful history of
        its corruption, its asceticism, and its intolerance, the various
        transformations it produced or underwent when the turbid waters of
        the barbarian invasions had inundated the civilisations of Europe. It
        remains for me, before concluding this work, to investigate one class
        of subjects to which I have, as yet, but briefly adverted—to examine
        the effects of the changes I have described upon the character and
        position of woman, and upon the grave moral questions concerning the
        relations of the sexes.</p>

        Women.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the long series
        of moral revolutions that have been described in the foregoing
        chapters, I have more than once had occasion to refer to the position
        that was assigned to woman in the community, and to the virtues and
        vices that spring directly from the relations of the sexes. I have
        not, however, as yet discussed these questions with a fulness at all
        corresponding to their historical importance, and I propose, in
        consequence, before concluding this volume, to devote a few pages to
        their examination. Of all the many questions that are treated in this
        work, there is none which I approach with so much hesitation, for
        there is probably none which it is so difficult to treat with
        clearness and impartiality, and at the same time without exciting any
        scandal or offence. The complexity of the problem, arising from the
        very large place which exceptional institutions or circumstances, and
        especially the influence of climate and race, have had on the
        chastity of nations, I have already noticed, and the extreme delicacy
        of the matters with which this branch of ethics is connected must be
        palpable to all. The first duty of an historian, however, is to
        truth; and it is absolutely impossible to present a true picture of
        the moral condition of different ages, and to form a true estimate of
        the moral effects of different religions, without adverting to the
        department of morals, which has exhibited most change, and has
        probably exercised most influence.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is natural
        that, in the period when men are still perfect barbarians, when their
        habits of life are still nomadic, and when, war and the chase, being
        their sole pursuits, the qualities that are required in these form
        their chief measure of excellence, the inferiority of women to men
        should be regarded as undoubted, and their position should be
        extremely degraded. In all those qualities which are then most
        prized, women are indisputably inferior. The social qualities in
        which they are especially fitted to excel have no sphere for their
        display. The ascendancy of beauty is very faint, and, even if it were
        otherwise, few traces of female beauty could survive the hardships of
        the savage life. Woman is looked upon merely as the slave of man, and
        as the minister to his passions. In the first capacity, her life is
        one of continual, abject, and unrequited toil. In the second
        capacity, she is exposed to all the violent revulsions of feeling
        that follow, among rude men, the gratification of the animal
        passions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even in this early
        stage, however, we may trace some rudiments of those moral sentiments
        which are destined at a later period to expand. The institution of
        marriage exists. The value of chastity is commonly in some degree
        felt, and appears in the indignation which is displayed against the
        adulterer. The duty of restraining the passions is largely recognised
        in the female, though the males are only restricted by the
        prohibition of adultery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first two
        steps which are taken towards the elevation of woman are probably the
        abandonment of the custom of purchasing wives, and the construction
        of the family on the basis of monogamy. In the earliest periods of
        civilisation, the marriage contract was arranged between the
        bridegroom and the father of the bride, on the condition of a sum of
        money being paid by the former to the latter. This sum, which is
        known in the laws of the barbarians as the <span class=

        father for the cession of his daughter, who thus became the bought
        slave of her husband. It is one of the most remarkable features of
        the ancient laws of India, that they forbade this gift, on the ground
        that the parent should not sell his child;<a id="noteref_553" name=

        there can be little doubt that this sale was at one time the ordinary
        type of marriage. In the Jewish writings we find Jacob purchasing
        Leah and Rachel by certain services to their father; and this custom,
        which seems to have been at one time general in Judea,<a id=
        "noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href="#note_554"><span class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">554</span></span></a> appears
        in the age of Homer to have been general in Greece. At an early
        period, however, of Greek history, the purchase-money was replaced by
        the dowry, or sum of money paid by the father of the bride for the
        use of his daughter;<a id="noteref_555" name="noteref_555" href=
        "#note_555"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">555</span></span></a> and
        this, although it passed into the hands of the husband, contributed
        to elevate the wife, in the first place, by the dignity it gave her,
        and, in the next place, by special laws, which both in Greece and
        Rome secured it to her in most cases of separation.<a id=
        "noteref_556" name="noteref_556" href="#note_556"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">556</span></span></a> The
        wife thus possessed a guarantee against ill-usage by her husband. She
        ceased to be his slave, and became in some degree a contracting
        party. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name=
        "Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Among the early
        Germans, a different and very remarkable custom existed. The bride
        did not bring any dowry to her husband, nor did the bridegroom give
        anything to the father of the bride; but he gave his gift to the
        bride herself, on the morning after the first night of marriage, and
        this, which was called the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Morgengab,”</span> or morning gift, was the origin of
        the jointure.<a id="noteref_557" name="noteref_557" href=
        "#note_557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still more
        important than the foregoing was the institution of monogamy, by
        which, from its earliest days, the Greek civilisation proclaimed its
        superiority to the Asiatic civilisations that had preceded it. We may
        regard monogamy either in the light of our intuitive moral sentiment
        on the subject of purity, or in the light of the interests of
        society. In its Oriental or polygamous stage, marriage is regarded
        almost exclusively, in its lowest aspect, as a gratification of the
        passions; while in European marriages the mutual attachment and
        respect of the contracting parties, the formation of a household, and
        the long train of domestic feelings and duties that accompany it,
        have all their distinguished place among the motives of the contract,
        and the lower element has comparatively little prominence. In this
        way it may be intelligibly said, without any reference to utilitarian
        considerations, that monogamy is a higher state than polygamy. The
        utilitarian arguments in its defence are also extremely powerful, and
        may be summed up in three sentences. Nature, by making the number of
        males and females nearly equal, indicates it as natural. In no other
        form of marriage can the government of the family, which is one of
        the chief ends of marriage, be so happily sustained, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and in no other does woman assume the
        position of the equal of man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Monogamy was the
        general system in Greece, though there are said to have been slight
        and temporary deviations into the earlier system, after some great
        disasters, when an increase of population was ardently desired.<a id=
        "noteref_558" name="noteref_558" href="#note_558"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">558</span></span></a> A broad
        line must, however, be drawn between the legendary or poetical
        period, as reflected in Homer and perpetuated in the tragedians, and
        the later historical period. It is one of the most remarkable, and to
        some writers one of the most perplexing, facts in the moral history
        of Greece, that in the former and ruder period women had undoubtedly
        the highest place, and their type exhibited the highest perfection.
        Moral ideas, in a thousand forms, have been sublimated, enlarged, and
        changed, by advancing civilisation; but it may be fearlessly asserted
        that the types of female excellence which are contained in the Greek
        poems, while they are among the earliest, are also among the most
        perfect in the literature of mankind. The conjugal tenderness of
        Hector and Andromache; the unwearied fidelity of Penelope, awaiting
        through the long revolving years the return of her storm-tossed
        husband, who looked forward to her as to the crown of all his
        labours; the heroic love of Alcestis, voluntarily dying that her
        husband might live; the filial piety of Antigone; the majestic
        grandeur of the death of Polyxena; the more subdued and saintly
        resignation of Iphigenia, excusing with her last breath the father
        who had condemned her; the joyous, modest, and loving Nausicaa, whose
        figure shines like a perfect idyll among the tragedies of the
        Odyssey—all these are pictures of perennial beauty, which Rome and
        Christendom, chivalry and modern civilisation, have neither eclipsed
        nor transcended. Virgin modesty and conjugal fidelity, the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280"
        id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> graces as well as the virtues
        of the most perfect womanhood, have never been more exquisitely
        pourtrayed. The female figures stand out in the canvas almost as
        prominently as the male ones, and are surrounded by an almost equal
        reverence. The whole history of the Siege of Troy is a history of the
        catastrophes that followed a violation of the nuptial tie. Yet, at
        the same time, the position of women was in some respects a degraded
        one. The custom of purchase-money given to the father of the bride
        was general. The husbands appear to have indulged largely, and with
        little or no censure, in concubines.<a id="noteref_559" name=
        "noteref_559" href="#note_559"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">559</span></span></a> Female
        captives of the highest rank were treated with great harshness. The
        inferiority of women to men was strongly asserted, and it was
        illustrated and defended by a very curious physiological notion, that
        the generative power belonged exclusively to men, women having only a
        very subordinate part in the production of their children.<a id=
        "noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href="#note_560"><span class=

        woman Pandora was said to have been the author of all human ills.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the historical
        age of Greece, the legal position of women had in some respects
        slightly improved, but their moral condition had undergone a marked
        deterioration. Virtuous women lived a life of perfect seclusion. The
        foremost and most dazzling type of Ionic womanhood was the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281"
        id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> courtesan, while, among the
        men, the latitude accorded by public opinion was almost
        unrestricted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The facts in moral
        history, which it is at once most important and most difficult to
        appreciate, are what may be called the facts of feeling. It is much
        easier to show what men did or taught than to realise the state of
        mind that rendered possible such actions or teaching; and in the case
        before us we have to deal with a condition of feeling so extremely
        remote from that of our own day, that the difficulty is preeminently
        great. Very sensual, and at the same time very brilliant societies,
        have indeed repeatedly existed, and the histories of both France and
        Italy afford many examples of an artistic and intellectual enthusiasm
        encircling those who were morally most frail; but the peculiarity of
        Greek sensuality is, that it grew up, for the most part, uncensured,
        and indeed even encouraged, under the eyes of some of the most
        illustrious of moralists. If we can imagine Ninon de l'Enclos at a
        time when the rank and splendour of Parisian society thronged her
        drawing-rooms, reckoning a Bossuet or a Fénelon among her
        followers—if we can imagine these prelates publicly advising her
        about the duties of her profession, and the means of attaching the
        affections of her lovers—we shall have conceived a relation scarcely
        more strange than that which existed between Socrates and the
        courtesan Theodota.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to
        reconstruct, as far as possible, the modes of feeling of the Greek
        moralists, it will be necessary in the first place to say a few words
        concerning one of the most delicate, but at the same time most
        important, problems with which the legislator and the moralist have
        to deal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a favourite
        doctrine of the Christian Fathers, that concupiscence, or the sensual
        passion, was <span class="tei tei-q">“the original sin”</span> of
        human nature; and it must be owned that the progress of knowledge,
        which is usually extremely opposed to the ascetic theory of life,
        concurs with the theological view, in showing <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the natural force of this appetite to be
        far greater than the well-being of man requires. The writings of
        Malthus have proved, what the Greek moralists appear in a
        considerable degree to have seen, that its normal and temperate
        exercise in the form of marriage, would produce, if universal, the
        utmost calamities to the world, and that, while nature seems in the
        most unequivocal manner to urge the human race to early marriages,
        the first condition of an advancing civilisation in populous
        countries is to restrain or diminish them. In no highly civilised
        society is marriage general on the first development of the passions,
        and the continual tendency of increasing knowledge is to render such
        marriages more rare. It is also an undoubted truth that, however much
        moralists may enforce the obligation of extra-matrimonial purity,
        this obligation has never been even approximately regarded; and in
        all nations, ages, and religions a vast mass of irregular indulgence
        has appeared, which has probably contributed more than any other
        single cause to the misery and the degradation of man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are two ends
        which a moralist, in dealing with this question, will especially
        regard—the natural duty of every man doing something for the support
        of the child he has called into existence, and the preservation of
        the domestic circle unassailed and unpolluted. The family is the
        centre and the archetype of the State, and the happiness and goodness
        of society are always in a very great degree dependent upon the
        purity of domestic life. The essentially exclusive nature of marital
        affection, and the natural desire of every man to be certain of the
        paternity of the child he supports, render the incursions of
        irregular passions within the domestic circle a cause of extreme
        suffering. Yet it would appear as if the excessive force of these
        passions would render such incursions both frequent and
        inevitable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under these
        circumstances, there has arisen in society a figure which is
        certainly the most mournful, and in some <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> respects the most awful, upon which the eye of
        the moralist can dwell. That unhappy being whose very name is a shame
        to speak; who counterfeits with a cold heart the transports of
        affection, and submits herself as the passive instrument of lust; who
        is scorned and insulted as the vilest of her sex, and doomed, for the
        most part, to disease and abject wretchedness and an early death,
        appears in every age as the perpetual symbol of the degradation and
        the sinfulness of man. Herself the supreme type of vice, she is
        ultimately the most efficient guardian of virtue. But for her, the
        unchallenged purity of countless happy homes would be polluted, and
        not a few who, in the pride of their untempted chastity, think of her
        with an indignant shudder, would have known the agony of remorse and
        of despair. On that one degraded and ignoble form are concentrated
        the passions that might have filled the world with shame. She
        remains, while creeds and civilisations rise and fall, the eternal
        priestess of humanity, blasted for the sins of the people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In dealing with
        this unhappy being, and with all of her sex who have violated the law
        of chastity, the public opinion of most Christian countries
        pronounces a sentence of extreme severity. In the Anglo-Saxon nations
        especially, a single fault of this kind is sufficient, at least in
        the upper and middle classes, to affix an indelible brand which no
        time, no virtues, no penitence can wholly efface. This sentence is
        probably, in the first instance, simply the expression of the
        religious feeling on the subject, but it is also sometimes defended
        by powerful arguments drawn from the interests of society. It is said
        that the preservation of domestic purity is a matter of such
        transcendent importance that it is right that the most crushing
        penalties should be attached to an act which the imagination can
        easily transfigure, which legal enactments can never efficiently
        control, and to which the most violent passions may prompt. It is
        said, too, that an anathema which drives into obscurity all evidences
        of sensual passions <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg
        284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is
        peculiarly fitted to restrict their operation; for, more than any
        other passions, they are dependent on the imagination, which is
        readily fired by the sight of evil. It is added, that the emphasis
        with which the vice is stigmatised produces a corresponding
        admiration for the opposite virtue, and that a feeling of the most
        delicate and scrupulous honour is thus formed among the female
        population, which not only preserves from gross sin, but also
        dignifies and ennobles the whole character.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In opposition to
        these views, several considerations of much weight have been urged.
        It is argued that, however persistently society may ignore this form
        of vice, it exists nevertheless, and on the most gigantic scale, and
        that evil rarely assumes such inveterate and perverting forms as when
        it is shrouded in obscurity and veiled by an hypocritical appearance
        of unconsciousness. The existence in England of certainly not less
        than fifty thousand unhappy women,<a id="noteref_561" name=
        "noteref_561" href="#note_561"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">561</span></span></a> sunk in
        the very lowest depths of vice and misery, shows sufficiently what an
        appalling amount of moral evil is festering uncontrolled,
        undiscussed, and unalleviated, under the fair surface of a decorous
        society. In the eyes of every physician, and indeed in the eyes of
        most continental writers who have adverted to the subject, no other
        feature of English life appears so infamous as the fact that an
        epidemic, which is one of the most dreadful now existing among
        mankind, which communicates itself from the guilty husband to the
        innocent wife, and even transmits its taint to her offspring, and
        which the experience of other nations conclusively proves may be
        vastly diminished, should be suffered to rage unchecked <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> because the Legislature refuses to take
        official cognisance of its existence, or proper sanitary measures for
        its repression.<a id="noteref_562" name="noteref_562" href=
        "#note_562"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">562</span></span></a> If the
        terrible censure which English public opinion passes upon every
        instance of female frailty in some degree diminishes the number, it
        does not prevent such instances from being extremely numerous, and it
        immeasurably aggravates the suffering they produce. Acts which in
        other European countries would excite only a slight and transient
        emotion, spread in England, over a wide circle, all the bitterness of
        unmitigated anguish. Acts which naturally neither imply nor produce a
        total subversion of the moral feelings, and which, in other
        countries, are often followed by happy, virtuous, and affectionate
        lives, in England almost invariably lead to absolute ruin.
        Infanticide is greatly multiplied, and a vast proportion of those
        whose reputations and lives have been blasted by one momentary sin,
        are hurled into the abyss of habitual prostitution—a condition which,
        owing to the sentence of public opinion and the neglect of
        legislators, is in no other European country so hopelessly vicious or
        so irrevocable.<a id="noteref_563" name="noteref_563" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is added, too,
        that the immense multitude who are thus doomed to the extremity of
        life-long wretchedness are not always, perhaps not generally, of
        those whose dispositions seem naturally incapable of virtue. The
        victims of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg

        seduction are often led aside quite as much by the ardour of their
        affections, and by the vivacity of their intelligence, as by any
        vicious propensities.<a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564" href=

        the lowest grades, the most dispassionate observers have detected
        remains of higher feelings, which, in a different moral atmosphere,
        and under different moral husbandry, would have undoubtedly been
        developed.<a id="noteref_565" name="noteref_565" href=

        considerations, which I have very briefly indicated, and which I do
        not propose to discuss or to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        magnitude of the problem. In the Greek civilisation, legislators and
        moralists endeavoured to meet it by the cordial recognition of two
        distinct orders of womanhood<a id="noteref_567" name="noteref_567"
        href="#note_567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        wife, whose first duty was fidelity to her husband; the hetæra, or
        mistress, who subsisted by her fugitive attachments. The wives of the
        Greeks lived in almost absolute seclusion. They were usually married
        when very young. Their occupations were to weave, to spin, to
        embroider, to superintend the household, to care for their sick
        slaves. They lived in a special and retired part of the house. The
        more wealthy seldom went abroad, and never except when accompanied by
        a female slave; never attended the public spectacles; received no
        male visitors except in the presence of their husbands, and had not
        even a seat at their own tables when male guests were there. Their
        pre-eminent virtue was fidelity, and it is probable that this was
        very strictly and very generally observed. Their remarkable freedom
        from temptations, the public opinion which strongly discouraged any
        attempt to seduce them, and the ample sphere for illicit pleasures
        that was accorded to the other sex, all contributed to protect it. On
        the other hand, living, as they did, almost exclusively among their
        female slaves, being deprived of all the educating influence of male
        society, and having no place at those public spectacles which were
        the chief means of Athenian culture, their minds must necessarily
        have been exceedingly contracted. Thucydides doubtless expressed the
        prevailing sentiment of his countrymen when he said that the highest
        merit of woman is not to be spoken of either for good or for
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288"
        id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> evil; and Phidias illustrated
        the same feeling when he represented the heavenly Aphrodite standing
        on a tortoise, typifying thereby the secluded life of a virtuous
        woman.<a id="noteref_568" name="noteref_568" href=
        "#note_568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In their own
        restricted sphere their lives were probably not unhappy. Education
        and custom rendered the purely domestic life that was assigned to
        them a second nature, and it must in most instances have reconciled
        them to the extra-matrimonial connections in which their husbands too
        frequently indulged. The prevailing manners were very gentle.
        Domestic oppression is scarcely ever spoken of; the husband lived
        chiefly in the public place; causes of jealousy and of dissension
        could seldom occur; and a feeling of warm affection, though not a
        feeling of equality, must doubtless have in most cases spontaneously
        arisen. In the writings of Xenophon we have a charming picture of a
        husband who had received into his arms his young wife of fifteen,
        absolutely ignorant of the world and of its ways. He speaks to her
        with extreme kindness, but in the language that would be used to a
        little child. Her task, he tells her, is to be like a queen bee,
        dwelling continually at home and superintending the work of her
        slaves. She must distribute to each their tasks, must economise the
        family income, and must take especial care that the house is strictly
        orderly—the shoes, the pots, and the clothes always in their places.
        It is also, he tells her, a part of her duty to tend her sick slaves;
        but here his wife interrupted him, exclaiming, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nay, but that will indeed be the most agreeable of my
        offices, if such as I treat with kindness are likely to be grateful,
        and to love me more than before.”</span> With a very tender and
        delicate care to avoid everything resembling a reproach, the husband
        persuades his wife to give up the habits of wearing high-heeled
        boots, in order to appear tall, and of colouring her face with
        vermilion and white lead. He promises her that if she faithfully
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289"
        id="Pg289" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> performs her duties he will
        himself be the first and most devoted of her slaves. He assured
        Socrates that when any domestic dispute arose he could extricate
        himself admirably, if he was in the right; but that, whenever he was
        in the wrong, he found it impossible to convince his wife that it was
        otherwise.<a id="noteref_569" name="noteref_569" href=
        "#note_569"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have another
        picture of Greek married life in the writings of Plutarch, but it
        represents the condition of the Greek mind at a later period than
        that of Xenophon. In Plutarch the wife is represented not as the mere
        housekeeper, or as the chief slave of her husband, but as his equal
        and his companion. He enforces, in the strongest terms, reciprocity
        of obligations, and desires that the minds of women should be
        cultivated to the highest point.<a id="noteref_570" name=
        "noteref_570" href="#note_570"><span class=

        precepts of marriage, indeed, fall little if at all below any that
        have appeared in modern days. His letter of consolation to his wife,
        on the death of their child, breathes a spirit of the tenderest
        affection. It is recorded of him that, having had some dispute with
        the relations of his wife, she feared that it might impair their
        domestic happiness, and she accordingly persuaded her husband to
        accompany her on a pilgrimage to Mount Helicon, where they offered up
        together a sacrifice to Love, and prayed that their affection for one
        another might never be diminished.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In general,
        however, the position of the virtuous Greek woman was a very low one.
        She was under a perpetual tutelage: first of all to her parents, who
        disposed of her hand, then to her husband, and in her days of
        widowhood to her sons. In cases of inheritance her male relations
        were preferred to her. The privilege of divorce, which, in Athens, at
        least, she possessed as well as her husband, appears to have been
        practically almost nugatory, on account of the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> shock which public declarations in the
        law court gave to the habits which education and public opinion had
        formed. She brought with her, however, a dowry, and the recognised
        necessity of endowing daughters was one of the causes of those
        frequent expositions which were perpetrated with so little blame. The
        Athenian law was also peculiarly careful and tender in dealing with
        the interests of female orphans.<a id="noteref_571" name=
        "noteref_571" href="#note_571"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">571</span></span></a> Plato
        had argued that women were equal to men; but the habits of the people
        were totally opposed to this theory. Marriage was regarded chiefly in
        a civic light, as the means of producing citizens, and in Sparta it
        was ordered that old or infirm husbands should cede their young wives
        to stronger men, who could produce vigorous soldiers for the State.
        The Lacedæmonian treatment of women, which differed in many respects
        from that which prevailed in the other Greek States, while it was
        utterly destructive of all delicacy of feeling or action, had
        undoubtedly the effect of producing a fierce and masculine
        patriotism; and many fine examples are recorded of Spartan mothers
        devoting their sons on the altar of their country, rejoicing over
        their deaths when nobly won, and infusing their own heroic spirit
        into the armies of the people. For the most part, however, the names
        of virtuous women seldom appear in Greek history. The simple modesty
        which was evinced by Phocion's wife, in the period when her husband
        occupied the foremost position in Athens,<a id="noteref_572" name=
        "noteref_572" href="#note_572"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">572</span></span></a> and a
        few instances of conjugal and filial affection, have been recorded;
        but in general the only women who attracted the notice of the people
        were the hetæræ, or courtesans.<a id="noteref_573" name="noteref_573"
        href="#note_573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">573</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb"

        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to
        understand the position which these last assumed in Greek life, we
        must transport ourselves in thought into a moral latitude totally
        different from our own. The Greek conception of excellence was the
        full and perfect development of humanity in all its organs and
        functions, and without any tinge of asceticism. Some parts of human
        nature were recognised as higher than others; and to suffer any of
        the lower appetites to obscure the mind, restrain the will and
        engross the energies of life, was acknowledged to be disgraceful; but
        the systematic repression of a natural appetite was totally foreign
        to Greek modes of thought. Legislators, moralists, and the general
        voice of the people, appear to have applied these principles almost
        unreservedly to intercourse between the sexes, and the most virtuous
        men habitually and openly entered into relations which would now be
        almost universally censured.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The experience,
        however, of many societies has shown that a public opinion may
        accord, in this respect, almost unlimited licence to one sex, without
        showing any corresponding indulgence to the other. But, in Greece, a
        concurrence of causes had conspired to bring a certain section of
        courtesans into a position they have in no other society attained.
        The voluptuous worship of Aphrodite gave a kind of religious sanction
        to their profession. Courtesans were the priestesses in her temples,
        and those of Corinth were believed by their prayers to have averted
        calamities from their city. Prostitution is said to have entered into
        the religious rites of Babylon, Biblis, Cyprus, and Corinth, and
        these as well as Miletus, Tenedos, Lesbos, and Abydos became famous
        for their schools of vice, which grew up under the shadow of the
        temples.<a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href=
        "#note_574"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the next place,
        the intense æsthetic enthusiasm that prevailed was eminently fitted
        to raise the most beautiful to honour. In a land and beneath a sky
        where natural beauty developed to the highest point, there arose a
        school of matchless artists both in painting and in sculpture, and
        public games and contests were celebrated, in which supreme physical
        perfection was crowned by an assembled people. In no other period of
        the world's history was the admiration of beauty in all its forms so
        passionate or so universal. It coloured the whole moral teaching of
        the time, and led the chief moralists to regard virtue simply as the
        highest kind of supersensual beauty. It appeared in all literature,
        where the beauty of form and style was the first of studies. It
        supplied at once the inspiration and the rule of all Greek art. It
        led the Greek wife to pray, before all other prayers, for the beauty
        of her children. It surrounded the most beautiful with an aureole of
        admiring reverence. The courtesan was often the queen of beauty. She
        was the model of the statues of Aphrodite, that commanded the
        admiration of Greece. Praxiteles was accustomed to reproduce the form
        of Phryne, and her statue, carved in gold, stood in the temple of
        Apollo at Delphi; and when she was accused of corrupting the youth of
        Athens, her advocate, Hyperides, procured her acquittal by suddenly
        unveiling her charms before the dazzled eyes of the assembled judges.
        Apelles was at once the painter and the lover of Laïs, and Alexander
        gave him, as the choicest gift, his own favourite concubine, of whom
        the painter had become enamoured while pourtraying her. The chief
        flower-painter of antiquity acquired his skill through his love of
        the flower-girl Glycera, whom he was accustomed to paint among her
        garlands. Pindar and Simonides sang the praises of courtesans, and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293"
        id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> grave philosophers made
        pilgrimages to visit them, and their names were known in every
        city.<a id="noteref_575" name="noteref_575" href=
        "#note_575"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
        surprising that, in such a state of thought and feeling, many of the
        more ambitious and accomplished women should have betaken themselves
        to this career, nor yet that they should have attained the social
        position which the secluded existence and the enforced ignorance of
        the Greek wives had left vacant. The courtesan was the one free woman
        of Athens, and she often availed herself of her freedom to acquire a
        degree of knowledge which enabled her to add to her other charms an
        intense intellectual fascination. Gathering around her the most
        brilliant artists, poets, historians, and philosophers, she flung
        herself unreservedly into the intellectual and æsthetic enthusiasms
        of her time, and soon became the centre of a literary society of
        matchless splendour. Aspasia, who was as famous for her genius as for
        her beauty, won the passionate love of Pericles. She is said to have
        instructed him in eloquence, and to have composed some of his most
        famous orations; she was continually consulted on affairs of state;
        and Socrates, like other philosophers, attended her assemblies.
        Socrates himself has owned his deep obligations to the instructions
        of a courtesan named Diotima. The courtesan Leontium was among the
        most ardent disciples of Epicurus.<a id="noteref_576" name=
        "noteref_576" href="#note_576"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another cause
        probably contributed indirectly to the elevation of this class, to
        which it is extremely difficult to allude in an English book, but
        which it is impossible altogether <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> to omit, even in the most cursory survey of
        Greek morals. Irregular female connections were looked upon as
        ordinary and not disgraceful incidents in the life of a good man, for
        they were compared with that lower abyss of unnatural love, which was
        the deepest and strangest taint of Greek civilisation. This vice,
        which never appears in the writings of Homer and Hesiod, doubtless
        arose under the influence of the public games, which, accustoming men
        to the contemplation of absolutely nude figures,<a id="noteref_577"
        name="noteref_577" href="#note_577"><span class=

        remote from all modern feelings, but which in Greece it was regarded
        as heroic to resist.<a id="noteref_579" name="noteref_579" href=

        popular religion in this, as in other cases, was made to bend to the
        new vice. Hebe, the cup-bearer of the gods, was replaced by Ganymede,
        and the worst vices of earth were transported to Olympus.<a id=

        the more effeminate Apollo; moralists were known to praise it as the
        bond of friendship, and it was spoken of as the inspiring enthusiasm
        of the heroic Theban legion of Epaminondas.<a id="noteref_581" name=

        general, however, it was stigmatised as unquestionably a vice, but it
        was treated with a levity we can now hardly conceive. We can scarcely
        have a better illustration of the extent to which moral ideas and
        feelings have changed, than the fact that the first two Greeks who
        were considered worthy of statues by their fellow-countrymen are said
        to have been Harmodius and Aristogeiton, who were united by an impure
        love, and who were glorified for a political assassination.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probable
        that this cause conspired with the others to dissociate the class of
        courtesans from the idea of supreme depravity with which they have
        usually been connected. The great majority, however, were sunk in
        this, as in all other ages, in abject degradation;<a id="noteref_583"

        comparatively few attained the condition of hetæræ, and even of these
        it is probable that the greater number exhibited the characteristics
        which in all ages have attached to their class. Faithlessness,
        extreme rapacity, and extravagant luxury, were common among them; but
        yet it is unquestionable that there were many exceptions. The
        excommunication of society did not press upon or degrade them; and
        though they were never regarded with the same honour as married
        women, it seems generally to have been believed that the wife and the
        courtesan had each her place and her function in the world, and her
        own peculiar type of excellence. The courtesan Leæna, who was a
        friend of Harmodius, died in torture rather than reveal <span class=

        Athenians, in allusion to her name, caused the statue of a tongueless
        lioness to be erected to commemorate her constancy.<a id=

        gentle manners and disinterested affection of a courtesan named
        Bacchis were especially recorded, and a very touching letter paints
        her character, and describes the regret that followed her to the
        tomb.<a id="noteref_585" name="noteref_585" href=

        of the most remarkable of his pictures of Greek life, Xenophon
        describes how Socrates, having heard of the beauty of the courtesan
        Theodota, went with his disciples to ascertain for himself whether
        the report was true; how with a quiet humour he questioned her about
        the sources of the luxury of her dwelling, and how he proceeded to
        sketch for her the qualities she should cultivate in order to attach
        her lovers. She ought, he tells her, to shut the door against the
        insolent, to watch her lovers in sickness, to rejoice greatly when
        they succeed in anything honourable, to love tenderly those who love
        her. Having carried on a cheerful and perfectly unembarrassed
        conversation with her, with no kind of reproach on his part, either
        expressed or implied, and with no trace either of the timidity or
        effrontery of conscious guilt upon hers, the best and wisest of the
        Greeks left his hostess with a graceful compliment to her
        beauty.<a id="noteref_586" name="noteref_586" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My task in
        describing this aspect of Greek life has been an eminently unpleasing
        one, and I should certainly not have entered upon even the baldest
        and most guarded disquisition on a subject so difficult, painful, and
        delicate, had it not been absolutely indispensable to a history of
        morals to give at least an outline of the progress that has
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297"
        id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> been effected in this sphere.
        What I have written will sufficiently explain why Greece, which was
        fertile, beyond all other lands, in great men, was so remarkably
        barren of great women. It will show, too, that while the Greek
        moralists recognised, like ourselves, the distinction between the
        higher and the lower sides of our nature, they differed very widely
        from modern public opinion in the standard of morals they enforced.
        The Christian doctrine, that it is criminal to gratify a powerful and
        a transient physical appetite, except under the condition of a
        lifelong contract, was altogether unknown. Strict duties were imposed
        upon Greek wives. Duties were imposed at a later period, though less
        strictly, upon the husband. Unnatural love was stigmatised, but with
        a levity of censure which to a modern mind appears inexpressibly
        revolting. Some slight legal disqualifications rested upon the whole
        class of hetæræ, and, though more admired, they were less respected
        than women who had adopted a domestic life; but a combination of
        circumstances had raised them, in actual worth and in popular
        estimation, to an unexampled elevation, and an aversion to marriage
        became very general, and extra-matrimonial connections were formed
        with the most perfect frankness and publicity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we now turn to
        the Roman civilisation, we shall find that some important advances
        had been made in the condition of women. The virtue of chastity has,
        as I have shown, been regarded in two different ways. The utilitarian
        view, which commonly prevails in countries where a political spirit
        is more powerful than a religious spirit, regards marriage as the
        ideal state, and to promote the happiness, sanctity, and security of
        this state is the main object of all its precepts. The mystical view
        which rests upon the natural feeling of shame, and which, as history
        proves, has prevailed especially where political sentiment is very
        low, and religious sentiment very strong, regards virginity as its
        supreme type, and marriage as simply the most pardonable declension
        from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name=
        "Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ideal purity. It is, I
        think, a very remarkable fact, that at the head of the religious
        system of Rome we find two sacerdotal bodies which appear
        respectively to typify these ideas. The Flamens of Jupiter and the
        Vestal Virgins were the two most sacred orders in Rome. The
        ministrations of each were believed to be vitally important to the
        State. Each could officiate only within the walls of Rome. Each was
        appointed with the most imposing ceremonies. Each was honoured with
        the most profound reverence. But in one important respect they
        differed. The Vestal was the type of virginity, and her purity was
        guarded by the most terrific penalties. The Flamen, on the other
        hand, was the representative of Roman marriage in its strictest and
        holiest form. He was necessarily married. His marriage was celebrated
        with the most solemn rites. It could only be dissolved by death. If
        his wife died, he was degraded from his office.<a id="noteref_587"
        name="noteref_587" href="#note_587"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">587</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of these two
        orders, there can be no question that the Flamen was the most
        faithful expression of the Roman sentiments. The Roman religion was
        essentially domestic, and it was a main object of the legislator to
        surround marriage with every circumstance of dignity and solemnity.
        Monogamy was, from the earliest times, strictly enjoined; and it was
        one of the great benefits that have resulted from the expansion of
        Roman power, that it made this type dominant in Europe. In the
        legends of early Rome we have ample evidence both of the high moral
        estimate of women, and of their prominence in Roman life. The
        tragedies of Lucretia and of Virginia display a delicacy of honour, a
        sense of the supreme excellence of unsullied purity, which no
        Christian nation could surpass. The legends of the Sabine women
        interceding between their parents and their husbands, and thus saving
        the infant republic, and of the mother of Coriolanus <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> averting by her prayers the ruin
        impending over her country, entitled women to claim their share in
        the patriotic glories of Rome. A temple of Venus Calva was associated
        with the legend of Roman ladies, who, in an hour of danger, cut off
        their long tresses to make bowstrings for the soldiers.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">588</span></span></a> Another
        temple preserved to all posterity the memory of the filial piety of
        that Roman woman who, when her mother was condemned to be starved to
        death, obtained permission to visit her in her prison, and was
        discovered feeding her from her breast.<a id="noteref_589" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The legal
        position, however, of the Roman wife was for a long period extremely
        low. The Roman family was constituted on the principle of the
        uncontrolled authority of its head, both over his wife and over his
        children, and he could repudiate the former at will. Neither the
        custom of gifts to the father of the bride, nor the custom of
        dowries, appears to have existed in the earliest period of Roman
        history; but the father disposed absolutely of the hand of his
        daughter, and sometimes even possessed the power of breaking off
        marriages that had been actually contracted.<a id="noteref_590" name=

        Aristotle, that the superiority of the Greeks to the barbarians was
        shown, among other things, in the fact that the Greeks did not, like
        other nations, regard their wives as slaves, but treated them as
        helpmates and companions. A Roman writer has appealed, on the whole
        with greater justice, to the treatment of wives by his fellow
        countrymen, as a proof of the superiority of Roman to Greek
        civilisation. He has observed that while the Greeks kept their wives
        in a special quarter in the interior of their houses, and never
        permitted them to sit at banquets except with their relatives, or to
        see any male except in the presence of a relative, no Roman ever
        hesitated to lead his wife with him to the feast, or to place the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have already
        enumerated the chief causes of that complete dissolution of Roman
        morals which began shortly after the Punic wars, which contributed
        very largely to the destruction of the Republic, and which attained
        its climax under the Cæsars. There are few examples in history of a
        revolution pervading so completely every sphere of religious,
        domestic, social, and political life. Philosophical scepticism
        corroded the ancient religions. An inundation of Eastern luxury and
        Eastern morals submerged all the old habits of austere simplicity.
        The civil wars and the Empire degraded the character of the people,
        and the exaggerated prudery of republican manners only served to make
        the rebound into vice the more irresistible. In the fierce outburst
        of ungovernable and almost frantic depravity that marked this evil
        period, the violations of female virtue were infamously prominent.
        The vast multiplication of slaves, which is in every age peculiarly
        fatal to moral purity; the fact that a great proportion of those
        slaves were chosen from the most voluptuous provinces of the Empire;
        the games of Flora, in which races of naked courtesans were
        exhibited; the pantomimes, which derived their charms chiefly from
        the audacious indecencies of the actors; the influx of the Greek and
        Asiatic hetæræ who were attracted by the wealth of the metropolis;
        the licentious paintings which began to adorn every house; the rise
        of Baiæ, which rivalled the luxury and surpassed the beauty of the
        chief centres of Asiatic vice, combining with the intoxication of
        great wealth suddenly acquired, with the disruption, through many
        causes, of all the ancient habits and beliefs, and with the tendency
        to pleasure which the closing of the paths of honourable political
        ambition by the imperial <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg
        303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        despotism, naturally produced, had all their part in preparing those
        orgies of vice which the writers of the Empire reveal. Most scholars
        will, I suppose, retain a vivid recollection of the new insight into
        the extent and wildness of human guilt which they obtained when they
        first opened the pages of Suetonius or Lampridius; and the sixth
        Satire of Juvenal paints with a fierce energy, though probably with
        the natural exaggeration of a satirist, the extent to which
        corruption had spread among the women. It was found necessary, under
        Tiberius, to make a special law prohibiting members of noble houses
        from enrolling themselves as prostitutes.<a id="noteref_608" name=
        "noteref_608" href="#note_608"><span class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">608</span></span></a> The
        extreme coarseness of the Roman disposition prevented sensuality from
        assuming that æsthetic character which had made it in Greece the
        parent of Art, and had very profoundly modified its influence, while
        the passion for gladiatorial shows often allied it somewhat
        unnaturally with cruelty. There have certainly been many periods in
        history when virtue was more rare than under the Cæsars; but there
        has probably never been a period when vice was more extravagant or
        uncontrolled. Young emperors especially, who were surrounded by
        swarms of sycophants and panders, and who often lived in continual
        dread of assassination, plunged with the most reckless and feverish
        excitement into every variety of abnormal lust. The reticence which
        has always more or less characterised modern society and modern
        writers was unknown, and the unblushing, undisguised obscenity of the
        Epigrams of Martial, of the Romances of Apuleius and Petronius, and
        of some of the Dialogues of Lucian, reflected but too faithfully the
        spirit of their time.</p>

        singularly curious speech is preserved, which is said to have been
        delivered on this subject, shortly before the close of the Republic,
        by Metellus Numidicus, in order, if possible, to overcome this
        indisposition. <span class="tei tei-q">“If, Romans,”</span> he said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“we could live without wives, we should all
        keep free from that source of trouble; but since nature has ordained
        that men can neither live sufficiently agreeably with wives, nor at
        all without them, let us consider the perpetual endurance of our race
        rather than our own brief enjoyment.”</span><a id="noteref_610" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the midst of
        this torrent of corruption a great change was passing over the legal
        position of Roman women. They had at first been in a condition of
        absolute subjection or subordination to their relations. They
        arrived, during the Empire, at a point of freedom and dignity which
        they subsequently lost, and have never altogether regained. The
        Romans recognised two distinct classes of marriages: the stricter,
        and, in the eyes of the law, more honourable, forms, which placed the
        woman <span class="tei tei-q">“in the hand”</span> of her husband and
        gave him an almost absolute authority over her person and her
        property; and a less strict form, which left her <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> legal position unchanged. The former,
        which were general during the Republic, were of three kinds—the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“confarreatio,”</span> which was celebrated
        and could only be dissolved by the most solemn religious ceremonies,
        and was jealously restricted to patricians; the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“coemptio,”</span> which was purely civil, and derived
        its name from a symbolical sale; and the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“usus,”</span> which was effected by the mere
        cohabitation of a woman with a man without interruption for the space
        of a year. Under the Empire, however, these kinds of marriage became
        almost wholly obsolete; a laxer form, resting upon a simple mutual
        agreement, without any religious or civil ceremony, was general, and
        it had this very important consequence, that the woman so married
        remained, in the eyes of the law, in the family of her father, and
        was under his guardianship, not under the guardianship of her
        husband. But the old <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">patria
        potestas</span></span> had become completely obsolete, and the
        practical effect of the general adoption of this form of marriage was
        the absolute legal independence of the wife. With the exception of
        her dowry, which passed into the hands of her husband, she held her
        property in her own right; she inherited her share of the wealth of
        her father, and she retained it altogether independently of her
        husband. A very considerable portion of Roman wealth thus passed into
        the uncontrolled possession of women. The private man of business of
        the wife was a favourite character with the comedians, and the
        tyranny exercised by rich wives over their husbands—to whom it is
        said they sometimes lent money at high interest—a continual theme of
        satirists.<a id="noteref_611" name="noteref_611" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A complete
        revolution had thus passed over the constitution <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the family. Instead of being
        constructed on the principle of autocracy, it was constructed on the
        principle of coequal partnership. The legal position of the wife had
        become one of complete independence, while her social position was
        one of great dignity. The more conservative spirits were naturally
        alarmed at the change, and two measures were taken to arrest it. The
        Oppian law was designed to restrain the luxury of women; but, in
        spite of the strenuous exertions of Cato, this law was speedily
        repealed.<a id="noteref_612" name="noteref_612" href=
        "#note_612"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">612</span></span></a> A more
        important measure was the Voconian law, which restricted within very
        narrow limits the property which women might inherit; but public
        opinion never fully acquiesced in it, and by several legal
        subterfuges its operation was partially evaded.<a id="noteref_613"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another and a
        still more important consequence resulted from the changed form of
        marriage. Being looked upon merely as a civil contract, entered into
        for the happiness of the contracting parties, its continuance
        depended upon mutual consent. Either party might dissolve it at will,
        and the dissolution gave both parties a right to remarry. There can
        be no question that under this system the obligations of marriage
        were treated with extreme levity. We find Cicero repudiating his wife

        twenty-first wife.<a id="noteref_624" name="noteref_624" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are, no
        doubt, extreme cases; but it is unquestionable that the stability of
        married life was very seriously impaired. It would be easy, however,
        to exaggerate the influence of legal changes in affecting it. In a
        purer state of public opinion a very wide latitude of divorce might
        probably have been allowed to both parties, without any serious
        consequence. The right of repudiation, which the husband had always
        possessed, was, as we have seen, in the Republic never or very rarely
        exercised. Of those who scandalised good men by the rapid recurrence
        of their marriages, probably <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> most, if marriage had been indissoluble, would
        have refrained from entering into it, and would have contented
        themselves with many informal connections, or, if they had married,
        would have gratified their love of change by simple adultery. A vast
        wave of corruption had flowed in upon Rome, and under any system of
        law it would have penetrated into domestic life. Laws prohibiting all
        divorce have never secured the purity of married life in ages of
        great corruption, nor did the latitude which was accorded in imperial
        Rome prevent the existence of a very large amount of female
        virtue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have observed,
        in a former chapter, that the moral contrasts shown in ancient life
        surpass those of modern societies, in which we very rarely find
        clusters of heroic or illustrious men arising in nations that are in
        general very ignorant or very corrupt. I have endeavoured to account
        for this fact by showing that the moral agencies of antiquity were in
        general much more fitted to develop virtue than to repress vice, and
        that they raised noble natures to almost the highest conceivable
        point of excellence, while they entirely failed to coerce or to
        attenuate the corruption of the depraved. In the female life of
        Imperial Rome we find these contrasts vividly displayed. There can be
        no question that the moral tone of the sex was extremely low—lower,
        probably, than in France under the Regency, or in England under the
        Restoration—and it is also certain that frightful excesses of
        unnatural passion, of which the most corrupt of modern courts present
        no parallel, were perpetrated with but little concealment on the
        Palatine. Yet there is probably no period in which examples of
        conjugal heroism and fidelity appear more frequently than in this
        very age, in which marriage was most free and in which corruption was
        so general. Much simplicity of manners continued to co-exist with the
        excesses of an almost unbridled luxury. Augustus, we are told, used
        to make his daughters and granddaughters <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        assigned most of those noble examples of the constancy of Roman

        mankind. Who has not read with emotion of the tenderness and heroism
        of Porcia, claiming her right to share in the trouble which clouded
        her husband's brow; how, doubting her own courage, she did not
        venture to ask Brutus to reveal to her his enterprise till she had
        secretly tried her power of endurance by piercing her thigh with a
        knife; how once, and but once in his presence, her noble spirit
        failed, when, as she was about to separate from him for the last

        husband to the grave; when much blood had already flowed, her slaves
        and freedmen bound her wounds, and thus compelled her to live; but
        the Romans ever after observed with reverence the sacred pallor of

        Pætus was condemned to die by his own hand, those who knew the love
        which his wife Arria bore him, and the heroic fervour of her
        character, predicted that she would not long survive him. Thrasea,
        who had married her daughter, endeavoured to dissuade her from
        suicide by saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“If I am ever called upon
        to perish, would you wish your daughter to die with me?”</span> She
        answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, if she will have then lived
        with you as long and as happily as I with Pætus.”</span> Her friends
        attempted, by carefully watching her, to secure her safety, but she
        dashed her head against the wall with such force that she fell upon
        the ground, and then, rising up, she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        told you I would find a hard way to death if you refuse me an easy
        way.”</span> All attempts to restrain her were then abandoned, and
        her death was perhaps the most majestic in antiquity. Pætus for a
        moment hesitated to strike the fatal blow; but his wife, taking the
        dagger, plunged it deeply into her own breast, and then, drawing it
        out, gave it, all reeking as it was, to her husband, exclaiming, with
        her dying breath, <span class="tei tei-q">“My Pætus, it does not
        pain.”</span><a id="noteref_633" name="noteref_633" href=

        unknown and inhospitable regions from which the Roman imagination
        recoiled with a peculiar horror, many noble ladies freely followed
        their husbands, and there were some wives who <span class=

        Incidental notices in historians, and a few inscriptions which have
        happened to remain, show us that such instances were not uncommon,

        fondly over the shoulder of the other, united in death as they had

        altogether unfelt; but they were rarely or never enforced, nor were
        they ever regarded as bearing any kind of equality to those imposed
        upon the wife. The term adultery, and all the legal penalties
        connected with it, were restricted to the infractions by a wife of
        the nuptial tie. Among the many instances of magnanimity recorded of
        Roman wives, few are more touching than that of Tertia Æmilia, the
        faithful wife of Scipio. She discovered that her husband had become

        its appearance in a formal judgment of Antoninus Pius, who, while
        issuing, at the request of a husband, a condemnation for adultery
        against a guilty wife, appended to it this remarkable condition:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Provided always it is established that by

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another change,
        which may be dimly descried in the later Pagan society, was a
        tendency to regard purity rather in a mystical point of view, as
        essentially good, than in the utilitarian point of view. This change
        resulted chiefly from the rise of the Neoplatonic and Pythagorean
        philosophies, which concurred in regarding the body, with its
        passions, as essentially evil, and in representing all virtue as a
        purification from its taint. Its most important consequence was a
        somewhat stricter view of pre-nuptial unchastity, which in the case
        of men, and when it was not excessive, and did not take the form of
        adultery, had previously been uncensured, or was looked upon with a
        disapprobation so slight as scarcely to amount to censure. The elder
        Cato had expressly justified it;<a id="noteref_651" name=

        Cicero has left us an extremely curious judgment on the subject,
        which shows at a glance the feelings of the people, and the vast
        revolution that, under the influence of Christianity, has been
        effected in, at least, the professions of mankind. <span class=

        the licence of our age, but also from the customs and allowances of
        our ancestors. When, indeed, was this not done? When was it blamed?

        feeling of the Romans is curiously exemplified in the life of
        Alexander Severus, who, of all the emperors, was probably the most
        energetic in legislating against vice. When appointing a provincial
        governor, he was accustomed to provide him with horses and servants,
        and, if he was unmarried, with a concubine, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“because,”</span> as the historian very gravely observes,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The foregoing
        facts, which I have given in the most condensed form, and almost
        unaccompanied by criticism or by comment, will be sufficient, I hope,
        to exhibit the state of feeling of the Romans on this subject, and
        also the direction in which that feeling was being modified. Those
        who are familiar with this order of studies will readily understand
        that it is impossible to mark out with precision the chronology of a
        moral sentiment; but there can be no question that in the latter days
        of the Roman Empire the perceptions of men on this subject became
        more subtle and more refined than they had previously been, and it is
        equally certain that the Oriental philosophies which had superseded
        Stoicism largely influenced the change. Christianity soon constituted
        itself the representative of the new tendency. It regarded purity as
        the most important of all virtues, and it strained to the utmost all
        the vast agencies it possessed, to enforce it. In the legislation of
        the first Christian emperors we find many traces of a fiery zeal.

        both of purity and of philanthropy, by a law which permitted
        actresses, on receiving baptism, to abandon their profession, which
        had been made a form of slavery, and was virtually a slavery to
        vice.<a id="noteref_663" name="noteref_663" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Side by side with
        the civil legislation, the penitential legislation of the Church was
        exerted in the same direction. Sins of unchastity probably occupy a
        larger place than any others in its enactments. The cases of
        unnatural love, and of mothers who had made their daughters
        courtesans, were punished by perpetual exclusion from communion, and
        a crowd of minor offences were severely visited. The ascetic passion
        increased the prominence of this branch of ethics, and the
        imaginations of men were soon fascinated by the pure and noble
        figures of the virgin martyrs of the Church, who on more than one
        occasion fully equalled the courage of men, while they sometimes
        mingled with their heroism traits of the most exquisite feminine
        gentleness. For the patient endurance of excruciating physical
        suffering, Christianity produced no more sublime figure than
        Blandina, the poor servant-girl who was martyred at Lyons; and it
        would be difficult to find in all history a more touching picture of
        natural purity than is contained in one simple incident of the
        martyrdom of St. Perpetua. It is related of that saint that she was
        condemned to be slaughtered by a wild bull, and, as she fell half
        dead from its horns upon the sand of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> arena, it was observed that even in that awful
        moment her virgin modesty was supreme, and her first instinctive
        movement was to draw together her dress, which had been torn in the
        assault.<a id="noteref_665" name="noteref_665" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A crowd of very
        curious popular legends also arose, which, though they are for the
        most part without much intrinsic excellence, have their importance in
        history, as showing the force with which the imaginations of men were
        turned in this direction, and the manner in which Christianity was
        regarded as the great enemy of the passions of the flesh. Thus, St.
        Jerome relates an incredible story of a young Christian, being, in
        the Diocletian persecution, bound with ribands of silk in the midst
        of a lovely garden, surrounded by everything that could charm the ear
        and the eye, while a beautiful courtesan assailed him with her
        blandishments, against which he protected himself by biting out his
        tongue and spitting it in her face.<a id="noteref_666" name=

        duty which his order imposed on him. He fell down on his knees and
        began repeating the Psalter, concluding every psalm with a prayer for
        his hostess. The strangeness of the scene, and the solemnity of his
        tone and manner, overawed and fascinated her. Gradually her tears
        began to flow. She knelt beside him and began to join in his prayers.
        He heeded her not, but hour after hour continued in the same stern
        and solemn voice, without rest and without interruption, to repeat
        his alternate prayers and psalms, till her repentance rose to a
        paroxysm of terror, and, as the grey morning streaks began to
        illumine the horizon, she fell half dead at his feet, imploring him
        with broken sobs to lead her anywhere where she might expiate the
        sins of her past.<a id="noteref_675" name="noteref_675" href=

        seriously counterbalanced by their noxious influence upon marriage.

        relation which nature has designed for the noble purpose of repairing
        the ravages of death, and which, as Linnæus has shown, extends even
        through the world of flowers, was invariably treated as a consequence
        of the fall of Adam, and marriage was regarded almost exclusively in
        its lowest aspect. The tender love which it elicits, the holy and
        beautiful domestic qualities that follow in its train, were almost
        absolutely omitted from consideration.<a id="noteref_678" name=

        object of the ascetic was to attract men to a life of virginity, and,
        as a necessary consequence, marriage was treated as an inferior
        state. It was regarded as being necessary, indeed, and therefore
        justifiable, for the propagation of the species, and to free men from
        greater evils; but still as a condition of degradation from which all
        who aspired to real sanctity should fly. To <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“cut down by the axe of Virginity the wood of

        when the bond had been formed, the ascetic passion retained its
        sting. We have already seen how it embittered other relations of
        domestic life. Into this, the holiest of all, it infused a tenfold
        bitterness. Whenever any strong religious fervour fell upon a husband
        or a wife, its first effect was to make a happy union impossible. The
        more religious partner immediately desired to live a life of solitary
        asceticism, or at least, if no ostensible separation took place, an
        unnatural life of separation in marriage. The immense place this
        order of ideas occupies in the hortatory writings of the Fathers, and
        in the legends of the saints, must be familiar to all who have any
        knowledge of this department of literature. Thus—to give but a very
        few examples—St. Nilus, when he had already two children, was seized
        with a longing for the prevailing asceticism, and his wife was
        persuaded, after many tears, to consent to their separation.<a id=

        could never be his. He resembled, he assures us, an ox that was
        ploughing a field, the fruit of which he must never enjoy; or a
        thirsty man, who was gazing on a stream of which he never can drink;
        or a poor man, whose poverty seems the more bitter as he contemplates
        the wealth of his neighbours; and he proceeded to descant in feeling

        marriages, in which the partners agreed to shun the marriage bed,
        became not uncommon. The emperor Henry II., Edward the Confessor, of
        England, and Alphonso II., of Spain, gave examples of it. A very
        famous and rather picturesque history of this kind is related by
        Gregory of Tours. A rich young Gaul, named Injuriosus, led to his
        home a young bride to whom he was passionately attached. That night,
        she confessed to him, with tears, that she had vowed to keep her
        virginity, and that she regretted bitterly the marriage into which
        her love for him had betrayed her. He told her that they should
        remain united, but that she should still observe her vow; and he
        fulfilled his promise. When, after several years, she died, her
        husband, in laying her in the tomb, declared, with great solemnity,
        that he restored her to God as immaculate as he had received her; and
        then a smile lit up the face of the dead woman, and she said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why do you tell that which no one asked
        you?”</span> The husband soon afterwards died, and his corpse, which
        had been laid in a distinct compartment from that of his wife in the
        tomb, was placed side by side with it by the angels.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The extreme
        disorders which such teaching produced in domestic life, and also the
        extravagances which grew up among some heretics, naturally alarmed
        the more judicious leaders of the Church, and it was ordained that
        married persons should not enter into an ascetic life, except by
        mutual consent.<a id="noteref_688" name="noteref_688" href=
        "#note_688"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">688</span></span></a> The
        ascetic ideal, however, remained unchanged. To abstain from marriage,
        or in marriage to abstain from a perfect union, was regarded as a
        proof of sanctity, and marriage was viewed in its coarsest and most
        degraded form. The notion of its impurity took many forms, and
        exercised for some centuries an extremely wide influence over the
        Church. Thus, it was the custom during the middle ages to abstain
        from the marriage bed during the night after the ceremony, in honour
        of the sacrament.<a id="noteref_689" name="noteref_689" href=
        "#note_689"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">689</span></span></a> It was
        expressly enjoined that no married persons should participate in any
        of the great Church festivals if the night before they had lain
        together, and St. Gregory the Great tells of a young wife who was
        possessed by a dæmon, because she had taken part in a procession of
        St. Sebastian, without fulfilling this condition.<a id="noteref_690"

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">690</span></span></a> The
        extent to which the feeling on the subject was carried is shown by
        the famous vision of Alberic in the twelfth century, in which a
        special place of torture, consisting of a lake of mingled lead,
        pitch, and resin is represented as existing in hell for the
        punishment of married people who had lain together on Church
        festivals or fast days.<a id="noteref_691" name="noteref_691" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two other
        consequences of this way of regarding marriage were a very strong
        disapproval of second marriages, and a very strong desire to secure
        celibacy in the clergy. The first of these notions had existed,
        though in a very different form, and connected with very different
        motives, among the early Romans, who were accustomed, we are told, to
        honour with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg
        325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        crown of modesty those who were content with one marriage, and to
        regard many marriages as a sign of illegitimate intemperance.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">692</span></span></a> This
        opinion appears to have chiefly grown out of a very delicate and
        touching feeling which had taken deep root in the Roman mind, that
        the affection a wife owes her husband is so profound and so pure that
        it must not cease even with his death; that it should guide and
        consecrate all her subsequent life, and that it never can be
        transferred to another object. Virgil, in very beautiful lines, puts
        this sentiment into the mouth of Dido;<a id="noteref_693" name=
        "noteref_693" href="#note_693"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">693</span></span></a> and
        several examples are recorded of Roman wives, sometimes in the prime
        of youth and beauty, upon the death of their husbands, devoting the
        remainder of their lives to retirement and to the memory of the
        dead.<a id="noteref_694" name="noteref_694" href=

        epithet <span class="tei tei-q">“univiræ”</span> inscribed on many

        case of men, the propriety of abstaining from second marriages was
        probably not felt so strongly as in the case of women, and what
        feeling on the subject existed was chiefly due to another
        motive—affection for the children, whose interests, it was thought,
        might be injured by a stepmother.<a id="noteref_699" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sentiment
        which thus recoiled from second marriages passed with a vastly
        increased strength into ascetic Christianity, but it was based upon
        altogether different grounds. We find, in the first place, that an
        affectionate remembrance of the husband had altogether vanished from
        the motives of the abstinence. In the next place, we may remark that
        the ecclesiastical writers, in perfect conformity with the extreme
        coarseness of their views about the sexes, almost invariably assumed
        that the motive to second or third marriages must be simply the force
        of the animal passions. The Montanists and the Novatians absolutely
        condemned second marriages.<a id="noteref_700" name="noteref_700"
        href="#note_700"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">700</span></span></a> The
        orthodox pronounced them lawful, on account of the weakness of human
        nature, but they viewed them with the most emphatic
        disapproval,<a id="noteref_701" name="noteref_701" href=
        "#note_701"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">701</span></span></a> partly
        because they considered them manifest signs of incontinence, and
        partly because they regarded them as inconsistent with their doctrine
        that marriage is an emblem of the union of Christ with the Church.
        The language of the Fathers on this subject appears to a modern mind
        most extraordinary, and, but for their distinct and reiterated
        assertion that they considered these marriages permissible,<a id=

        appear to amount to a peremptory condemnation. Thus—to give but a few

        forbids a second, what is to be said of third marriages? The first is

        marriages were at one time deemed absolutely unlawful, and much
        controversy was excited by the Emperor Leo the Wise, who, having had
        three wives, had taken a mistress, but afterwards, in defiance of the
        religious feelings of his people, determined to raise her to the
        position of a wife.<a id="noteref_712" name="noteref_712" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The subject of the
        celibacy of the clergy, in which the ecclesiastical feelings about
        marriage were also shown, is an extremely large one, and I shall not
        attempt to deal with it, except in a most cursory manner.<a id=

        are two facts connected with it which every candid student must
        admit. The first is, that in the earliest period of the Church, the
        privilege of marriage was accorded to the clergy. The second is, that
        a notion of the impurity of marriage existed, and that it was felt
        that the clergy, as pre-eminently the holy class, should have less
        licence than laymen. The first form this feeling took appears in the
        strong conviction that a second marriage of a priest, or the marriage
        of a priest with a widow, was unlawful and criminal.<a id=

        have existed from the earliest period of the Church, and was retained
        with great tenacity and unanimity through many centuries. In the next
        place, we find from an extremely early date an opinion, that it was
        an act of virtue, at a later period that it was an act of duty, for
        priests after ordination to abstain from cohabiting with their wives.
        The Council of Nice refrained, by the advice of Paphnutius, who was
        himself a scrupulous celibate, from imposing this last rule as a
        matter of necessity;<a id="noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href=
        "#note_715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a> but in
        the course of the fourth century it was a recognised principle that
        clerical marriages were criminal. They were celebrated, however,
        habitually, and usually with the greatest openness. The various
        attitudes assumed by the ecclesiastical authorities in dealing with
        this subject form an extremely curious page of the history of morals,
        and supply the most crushing evidence of the evils which have been
        produced by the system of celibacy. I can at present, however, only
        refer to the vast mass of evidence which has been collected on the
        subject, derived from the writings of Catholic divines and from the
        decrees of Catholic Councils during the space of many centuries. It
        is a popular illusion, which is especially common among writers who
        have little direct knowledge of the middle ages, that the atrocious
        immorality of monasteries, in the century before the Reformation, was
        a new fact, and that the ages when the faith of men was undisturbed,
        were ages of great moral purity. In fact, it appears, from the
        uniform testimony of the ecclesiastical writers, that ecclesiastical
        immorality in the eighth and three following centuries was little if
        at all less outrageous than in any other period, while the Papacy,
        during almost the whole of the tenth century, was held by men of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a name="Pg330"
        id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> infamous lives. Simony was
        nearly universal.<a id="noteref_716" name="noteref_716" href=

        Barbarian chieftains married at an early age, and totally incapable
        of restraint, occupied the leading positions in the Church, and gross
        irregularities speedily became general. An Italian bishop of the
        tenth century epigrammatically described the morals of his time, when
        he declared, that if he were to enforce the canons against unchaste
        people administering ecclesiastical rites, no one would be left in
        the Church except the boys; and if he were to observe the canons
        against bastards, these also must be excluded.<a id="noteref_717"

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">717</span></span></a> The
        evil acquired such magnitude that a great feudal clergy, bequeathing
        the ecclesiastical benefices from father to son, appeared more than
        once likely to arise.<a id="noteref_718" name="noteref_718" href=
        "#note_718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">718</span></span></a> A tax
        called <span class="tei tei-q">“Culagium,”</span> which was in fact a
        licence to clergymen to keep concubines, was during several centuries
        systematically levied by princes.<a id="noteref_719" name=

        Sometimes the evil, by its very extension, corrected itself. Priestly
        marriages were looked upon as normal events not implying any guilt,
        and in the eleventh century several instances are recorded in which
        they were not regarded as any impediment to the power of working
        miracles.<a id="noteref_720" name="noteref_720" href=
        "#note_720"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">720</span></span></a> But
        this was a rare exception. From the earliest period a long succession
        of Councils as well as such men as St. Boniface, St. Gregory the
        Great, St. Peter Damiani, St. Dunstan, St. Anselm, Hildebrand and his
        successors in the Popedom, denounced priestly marriage or concubinage
        as an atrocious crime, and the habitual life of the priests was, in
        theory at least, generally recognised as a life of sin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
        surprising that, having once broken their vows and begun to live what
        they deemed a life of habitual sin, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        level of the laity. We may not lay much stress on such isolated
        instances of depravity as that of Pope John XXIII., who was condemned
        among many other crimes for incest, and for adultery;<a id=

        is impossible to resist the evidence of a long chain of Councils and
        ecclesiastical writers, who conspire in depicting far greater evils
        than simple concubinage. It was observed that when the priests
        actually took wives the knowledge that these connections were illegal
        was peculiarly fatal to their fidelity, and bigamy and extreme
        mobility of attachments were especially common among them. The
        writers of the middle ages are full of accounts of nunneries that
        were like brothels, of the vast multitude of infanticides within
        their walls, and of that inveterate prevalence of incest among the
        clergy, which rendered it necessary again and again to issue the most
        stringent enactments that priests should not be permitted to live
        with their mothers or sisters. Unnatural love, which it had been one
        of the great services of Christianity almost to eradicate from the
        world, is more than once spoken of as lingering in the monasteries;
        and, shortly before the Reformation, complaints became loud and
        frequent of the employment of the confessional for the purposes of
        debauchery.<a id="noteref_725" name="noteref_725" href=
        "#note_725"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">725</span></span></a> The
        measures taken on the subject were very numerous and severe. At
        first, the evil chiefly complained of was the clandestine
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332"
        id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> marriage of priests, and
        especially their intercourse with wives whom they had married
        previous to their ordination. Several Councils issued their anathemas
        against priests <span class="tei tei-q">“who had improper relations
        with their wives;”</span> and rules were made that priests should
        always sleep in the presence of a subordinate clerk; and that they
        should only meet their wives in the open air and before at least two
        witnesses. Men were, however, by no means unanimous in their way of
        regarding this matter. Synesius, when elected to a bishopric, at
        first declined, boldly alleging as one of his reasons, that he had a
        wife whom he loved dearly, and who, he hoped, would bear him many
        sons, and that he did not mean to separate from her or visit her
        secretly as an adulterer.<a id="noteref_726" name="noteref_726" href=
        "#note_726"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">726</span></span></a> A
        Bishop of Laon, at a later date, who was married to a niece of St.
        Rémy, and who remained with his wife till after he had a son and a
        daughter, quaintly expressed his penitence by naming them
        respectively Latro and Vulpecula.<a id="noteref_727" name=

        Gregory the Great describes the virtue of a priest, who, through
        motives of piety, had discarded his wife. As he lay dying, she
        hastened to him to watch the bed which for forty years she had not
        been allowed to share, and, bending over what seemed the inanimate
        form of her husband, she tried to ascertain whether any breath still
        remained, when the dying saint, collecting his last energies,
        exclaimed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Woman, begone; take away the
        straw; there is fire yet.”</span><a id="noteref_728" name=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">728</span></span></a> The
        destruction of priestly marriage is chiefly due to Hildebrand, who
        pursued this object with the most untiring resolution. Finding that
        his appeals to the ecclesiastical authorities and to the civil rulers
        were insufficient, he boldly turned to the people, exhorted them, in
        defiance of all Church traditions, to withdraw their obedience from
        married priests, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg
        333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        kindled among them a fierce fanaticism of asceticism, which speedily
        produced a fierce persecution of the offending pastors. Their wives,
        in immense numbers, were driven forth with hatred and with scorn; and
        many crimes, and much intolerable suffering, followed the disruption.
        The priests sometimes strenuously resisted. At Cambrai, in
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1077, they burnt alive
        as a heretic a zealot who was maintaining the doctrines of
        Hildebrand. In England, half a century later, they succeeded in
        surprising a Papal legate in the arms of a courtesan, a few hours
        after he had delivered a fierce denunciation of clerical
        unchastity.<a id="noteref_729" name="noteref_729" href=
        "#note_729"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">729</span></span></a> But
        Papal resolution supported by popular fanaticism won the victory.
        Pope Urban II. gave licence to the nobles to reduce to slavery the
        wives whom priests had obstinately refused to abandon, and after a
        few more acts of severity priestly marriage became obsolete. The
        extent, however, of the disorders that still existed, is shown by the
        mournful confessions of ecclesiastical writers, by the uniform and
        indignant testimony of the poets and prose satirists who preceded the
        Reformation, by the atrocious immoralities disclosed in the
        monasteries at the time of their suppression, and by the significant
        prudence of many lay Catholics, who were accustomed to insist that
        their priest should take a concubine for the protection of the
        families of his parishioners.<a id="noteref_730" name="noteref_730"
        href="#note_730"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">730</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is scarcely
        possible to conceive a more demoralising influence than a priesthood
        living such a life as I have described. In Protestant countries,
        where the marriage of the clergy is fully recognised, it has, indeed,
        been productive of the greatest and the most unequivocal benefits.
        Nowhere, it may be confidently asserted, does Christianity assume a
        more beneficial or a more winning form than in those gentle clerical
        households which stud our land, constituting, as Coleridge said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the one idyll of modern life,”</span> the
        most perfect type of domestic peace, the centre of civilisation in
        the remotest village. Notwithstanding some class narrowness and
        professional bigotry, notwithstanding some unworthy, but half
        unconscious mannerism, which is often most unjustly stigmatised as
        hypocrisy, it would be difficult to find in any other quarter so much
        happiness at once diffused and enjoyed, or so much virtue attained
        with so little tension or struggle. Combining with his sacred calling
        a warm sympathy with the intellectual, social, and political
        movements of his time, possessing the enlarged practical knowledge of
        a father of a family, and entering with a keen zest into the
        occupations and the amusements of his parishioners, a good clergyman
        will rarely obtrude his religious convictions into secular spheres,
        but yet will make them apparent in all. They will be revealed by a
        higher and deeper moral tone, by a more scrupulous purity in word and
        action, by an all-pervasive gentleness, which refines, and softens,
        and mellows, and adds as much to the charm as to the excellence of
        the character <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg
        335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in
        which it is displayed. In visiting the sick, relieving the poor,
        instructing the young, and discharging a thousand delicate offices
        for which a woman's tact is especially needed, his wife finds a
        sphere of labour which is at once intensely active and intensely
        feminine, and her example is not less beneficial than her
        ministrations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Catholic
        priesthood, on the other hand, where the vow of celibacy is
        faithfully observed, a character of a different type is formed, which
        with very grave and deadly faults combines some of the noblest
        excellences to which humanity can attain. Separated from most of the
        ties and affections of earth, viewing life chiefly through the
        distorted medium of the casuist or the confessional, and deprived of
        those relationships which more than any others soften and expand the
        character, the Catholic priests have been but too often conspicuous
        for their fierce and sanguinary fanaticism, and for their
        indifference to all interests except those of their Church; while the
        narrow range of their sympathies, and the intellectual servitude they
        have accepted, render them peculiarly unfitted for the office of
        educating the young, which they so persistently claim, and which, to
        the great misfortune of the world, they were long permitted to
        monopolise. But, on the other hand, no other body of men have ever
        exhibited a more single-minded and unworldly zeal, refracted by no
        personal interests, sacrificing to duty the dearest of earthly
        objects, and confronting with undaunted heroism every form of
        hardship, of suffering, and of death.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the middle
        ages, even in their darkest periods, produced many good and great men
        of the latter type it would be unjust and absurd to deny. It can
        hardly, however, be questioned that the extreme frequency of illicit
        connections among the clergy tended during many centuries most
        actively to lower the moral tone of the laity, and to counteract the
        great services in the cause of purity which Christian teaching
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336"
        id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> had undoubtedly effected. The
        priestly connections were rarely so fully recognised as to enable the
        mistress to fill a position like that which is now occupied by the
        wife of a clergyman, and the spectacle of the chief teachers and
        exemplars of morals living habitually in an intercourse which was
        acknowledged to be ambiguous or wrong, must have acted most
        injuriously upon every class of the community. Asceticism,
        proclaiming war upon human nature, produced a revulsion towards its
        extreme opposite, and even when it was observed it was frequently
        detrimental to purity of mind. The habit of continually looking upon
        marriage in its coarsest light, and of regarding the propagation of
        the species as its one legitimate end, exercised a peculiarly
        perverting influence upon the imagination. The exuberant piety of
        wives who desired to live apart from their husbands often drove the
        latter into serious irregularities.<a id="noteref_731" name=
        "noteref_731" href="#note_731"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">731</span></span></a> The
        notion of sin was introduced into the dearest of relationships,<a id=
        "noteref_732" name="noteref_732" href="#note_732"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">732</span></span></a> and the
        whole subject was distorted and degraded. It is one of the great
        benefits of Protestantism that it did much to banish these modes of
        thought and feeling from the world, and to restore marriage to its
        simplicity and its dignity. We have a gratifying illustration
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337"
        id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the extent to which an old
        superstition has declined, in the fact that when Goldsmith, in his
        great romance, desired to depict the harmless eccentricities of his
        simple-minded and unworldly vicar, he represented him as maintaining
        that opinion concerning the sinfulness of the second marriage of a
        clergyman which was for many centuries universal in the Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another injurious
        consequence, resulting, in a great measure, from asceticism, was a
        tendency to depreciate extremely the character and the position of
        women. In this tendency we may detect in part the influence of the
        earlier Jewish writings, in which an impartial observer may find
        evident traces of the common Oriental depreciation of women. The
        custom of purchase-money to the father of the bride was admitted.
        Polygamy was authorised,<a id="noteref_733" name="noteref_733" href=
        "#note_733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">733</span></span></a> and
        practised by the wisest man on an enormous scale. A woman was
        regarded as the origin of human ills. A period of purification was
        appointed after the birth of every child; but, by a very significant
        provision, it was twice as long in the case of a female as of a male
        child.<a id="noteref_734" name="noteref_734" href=
        "#note_734"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">734</span></span></a>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The badness of men,”</span> a Jewish writer
        emphatically declared, <span class="tei tei-q">“is better than the
        goodness of women.”</span><a id="noteref_735" name="noteref_735"
        href="#note_735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">735</span></span></a> The
        types of female excellence exhibited in the early period of Jewish
        history are in general of a low order, and certainly far inferior to
        those of Roman history or Greek poetry; and the warmest eulogy of a
        woman in the Old Testament is probably that which was bestowed upon
        her who, with circumstances of the most aggravated treachery, had
        murdered the sleeping fugitive who had taken refuge under her
        roof.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg
        338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The combined
        influence of the Jewish writings, and of that ascetic feeling which
        treated women as the chief source of temptation to man, was shown in
        those fierce invectives, which form so conspicuous and so grotesque a
        portion of the writings of the Fathers, and which contrast so
        curiously with the adulation bestowed upon particular members of the
        sex. Woman was represented as the door of hell, as the mother of all
        human ills. She should be ashamed at the very thought that she is a
        woman. She should live in continual penance, on account of the curses
        she has brought upon the world. She should be ashamed of her dress,
        for it is the memorial of her fall. She should be especially ashamed
        of her beauty, for it is the most potent instrument of the dæmon.
        Physical beauty was indeed perpetually the theme of ecclesiastical
        denunciations, though one singular exception seems to have been made;
        for it has been observed that in the middle ages the personal beauty
        of bishops was continually noticed upon their tombs.<a id=
        "noteref_736" name="noteref_736" href="#note_736"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">736</span></span></a> Women
        were even forbidden by a provincial Council, in the sixth century, on
        account of their impurity, to receive the Eucharist into their naked
        hands.<a id="noteref_737" name="noteref_737" href=
        "#note_737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        essentially subordinate position was continually maintained.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probable
        that this teaching had its part in determining the principles of
        legislation concerning the sex. The Pagan laws during the Empire had
        been continually repealing the old disabilities of women, and the
        legislative movement in their favour continued with unabated force
        from Constantine to Justinian, and appeared also in some of the early
        laws of the barbarians.<a id="noteref_738" name="noteref_738" href=

        addition to the personal restrictions which grew necessarily out of
        the Catholic doctrines concerning divorce, and concerning the
        subordination of the weaker sex, we find numerous and stringent
        enactments, which rendered it impossible for women to succeed to any
        considerable amount of property, and which almost reduced them to the

        the greater part of the inheritance of their fathers, totally
        disappeared. Wherever the canon law has been the basis of
        legislation, we find laws of succession sacrificing the interests of
        daughters and of wives,<a id="noteref_741" name="noteref_741" href=

        French revolutionists, though rejecting the proposal of Siéyès and
        Condorcet to accord political emancipation to women, established at
        least an equal succession of sons and daughters, and thus initiated a
        great reformation of both law and opinion, which sooner or later must
        traverse the world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In their efforts
        to raise the standard of purity, the Christian teachers derived much
        assistance from the incursions and the conquests of the barbarians.
        The dissolution of vast retinues of slaves, the suspension of most
        public games, and the general impoverishment that followed the
        invasions, were all favourable to female virtue; and in this respect
        the various tribes of barbarians, however violent and lawless, were
        far superior to the more civilised community. Tacitus, in a very
        famous work, had long before pourtrayed in the most flattering
        colours the purity of the Germans. Adultery, he said, was very rare
        among them. The adulteress was driven from the house with shaven
        hair, and beaten ignominiously through the village. Neither youth,
        nor beauty, nor wealth could enable a woman who was known to have
        sinned to secure a husband. Polygamy was restricted to the princes,
        who looked upon a plurality of wives rather as a badge of dignity
        than as a gratification of the passions. Mothers invariably gave suck
        to their own children. Infanticide was forbidden. Widows were not
        allowed to re-marry. The men feared captivity, much more for their
        wives than for themselves; they believed that a sacred and prophetic
        gift resided in women; they consulted them as oracles, and followed
        their counsels.<a id="noteref_742" name="noteref_742" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is generally
        believed, and it is not improbable, that Tacitus in this work
        intended to reprove the dissolute habits of his fellow-countrymen,
        and considerably over-coloured the virtue of the barbarians. Of the
        substantial justice, however, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of his picture we have much evidence. Salvian,
        who, about three centuries later, witnessed and described the manners
        of the barbarians who had triumphed over the Empire, attested in the
        strongest language the contrast which their chastity presented to the
        vice of those whom they had subdued.<a id="noteref_743" name=

        barbarian women were accustomed to practise medicine and to interpret
        dreams, and they also very frequently accompanied their husbands to

        the fight.<a id="noteref_745" name="noteref_745" href=

        Augustus had discovered that it was useless to keep barbarian chiefs
        as hostages, and that the one way of securing the fidelity of
        traitors was by taking their wives, for these, at least, were never
        sacrificed. Instances of female heroism are said to have occurred in
        the conquered nations, which might rival the most splendid in the
        Roman annals. When Marius had vanquished an army of the Teutons,
        their wives besought the conqueror to permit them to become the
        servants of the Vestal Virgins, in order that their honour, at least,
        might be secure in slavery. Their request was refused, and that night
        they all perished by their own hands.<a id="noteref_746" name=

        Camma, who, faithful to her husband, resisted all his entreaties.
        Resolved at any hazard to succeed, he caused her husband to be
        assassinated, and when she took refuge in the temple of Diana, and
        enrolled herself among the priestesses, he sent noble after noble to
        induce her to relent. After a time, he ventured himself into her
        presence. She feigned <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg

        willingness to yield, but told him it was first necessary to make a
        libation to the goddess. She appeared as a priestess before the
        altar, bearing in her hand a cup of wine, which she had poisoned. She
        drank half of it herself, handed the remainder to her guilty lover,
        and when he had drained the cup to the dregs, burst into a fierce
        thanksgiving, that she had been permitted to avenge, and was soon to

        and still more remarkable instance of conjugal fidelity was furnished
        by a Gaulish woman named Epponina. Her husband, Julius Sabinus, had
        rebelled against Vespasian; he was conquered, and might easily have
        escaped to Germany, but could not bear to abandon his young wife. He
        retired to a villa of his own, concealed himself in subterranean
        cellars that were below it, and instructed a freedman to spread the
        report that he had committed suicide, while, to account for the
        disappearance of his body, he set fire to the villa. Epponina,
        hearing of the suicide, for three days lay prostrate on the ground
        without eating. At length the freedman came to her, and told her that
        the suicide was feigned. She continued her lamentations by day, but
        visited her husband by night. She became with child, but owing, it is
        said, to an ointment, she succeeded in concealing her state from her
        friends. When the hour of parturition was at hand, she went alone
        into the cellar, and without any assistance or attendance was
        delivered of twins, whom she brought up underground. For nine years
        she fulfilled her task, when Sabinus was discovered, and, to the
        lasting disgrace of Vespasian, was executed, in spite of the
        supplications of his wife, who made it her last request that she
        might be permitted to die with him.<a id="noteref_748" name=

        inculcated. It was concentrated exclusively upon marriage. It showed
        itself in a noble conjugal fidelity; but it was little fitted for a
        life of celibacy, and did not, as we have seen, prevent excessive
        disorders among the priesthood. The practice of polygamy among the
        barbarian kings was also for some centuries unchecked, or at least
        unsuppressed, by Christianity. The kings Caribert and Chilperic had
        both many wives at the same time.<a id="noteref_749" name=

        Theodebert, whose general goodness of character is warmly extolled by

        another, to whom he had previously been betrothed; and upon the death

        this period examples of this nature became rare. The Popes and the
        bishops exercised a strict supervision over domestic morals, and
        strenuously, and in most cases successfully, opposed the attempts of
        kings and nobles to repudiate their wives.</p><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But,
        notwithstanding these startling facts, there can be no doubt that the
        general purity of the barbarians was from the first superior to that
        of the later Romans, and it appears in many of their laws. It has
        been very happily observed,<a id="noteref_755" name="noteref_755"
        href="#note_755"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">755</span></span></a> that
        the high value placed on this virtue is well illustrated by the fact
        that in the Salic code, while a charge of cowardice falsely brought
        against a man was only punished by a fine of three solidi, a charge
        of unchastity falsely brought against a woman was punished by a fine
        of forty-five. The Teutonic sentiment was shown in a very stern
        legislation against adultery and rape,<a id="noteref_756" name=
        "noteref_756" href="#note_756"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">756</span></span></a> and
        curiously minute precautions were sometimes taken to guard against
        them. A law of the Spanish Visigoths prohibited surgeons from
        bleeding any free woman except in the presence of her husband, of her
        nearest relative, or at least of some properly appointed witness, and
        a Salic law imposed a fine of fifteen pieces of gold upon any one who
        improperly pressed her hand.<a id="noteref_757" name="noteref_757"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under the
        influence of Christianity, assisted by the barbarians, a vast change
        passed gradually over the world. The vice we are considering was
        probably more rare; it certainly assumed less extravagant forms, and
        it was screened from observation with a new modesty. The theory of
        morals had become clearer, and the practice was somewhat improved.
        The extreme grossness of literature had disappeared, and the more
        glaring violations of marriage were always censured and often
        repressed. The penitential discipline, and the exhortations of the
        pulpit, diffused abroad an immeasurably higher sense of the
        importance of purity than Pagan antiquity had known. St. Gregory the
        Great, following in the steps of some Pagan philosophers,<a id=
        "noteref_758" name="noteref_758" href="#note_758"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">758</span></span></a>
        strenuously urged upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg
        345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        mothers the duty of themselves suckling their children; and many
        minute and stringent precepts were made against extravagances of
        dress and manners. The religious institutions of Greece and Asia
        Minor, which had almost consecrated prostitution, were for ever
        abolished, and the courtesan sank into a lower stage of
        degradation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides these
        changes, the duty of reciprocal fidelity in marriage was enforced
        with a new earnestness. The contrast between the levity with which
        the frailty of men has in most ages been regarded, and the extreme
        severity with which women who have been guilty of the same offence
        have generally been treated, forms one of the most singular anomalies
        in moral history, and appears the more remarkable when we remember
        that the temptation usually springs from the sex which is so readily
        pardoned; that the sex which is visited with such crushing penalties
        is proverbially the most weak; and that, in the case of women, but
        not in the case of men, the vice is very commonly the result of the
        most abject misery and poverty. For this disparity of censure several
        reasons have been assigned. The offence can be more surely and easily
        detected, and therefore more certainly punished, in the case of women
        than of men; and, as the duty of providing for his children falls
        upon the father, the introduction into the family of children who are
        not his own is a special injury to him, while illegitimate children
        who do not spring from adultery will probably, on account of their
        father having entered into no compact to support them, ultimately
        become criminals or paupers, and therefore a burden to society.<a id=
        "noteref_759" name="noteref_759" href="#note_759"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">759</span></span></a> It may
        be added, I think, that several causes render the observance of this
        virtue more difficult for one sex than for the other; that its
        violation, when every allowance has been made for the moral
        degradation which is a result of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the existing condition of public opinion, is
        naturally more profoundly prejudicial to the character of women than
        of men; and also that much of our feeling on these subjects is due to
        laws and moral systems which were formed by men, and were in the
        first instance intended for their own protection.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passages in
        the Fathers, asserting the equality of the obligation imposed upon
        both sexes, are exceedingly unequivocal;<a id="noteref_760" name=
        "noteref_760" href="#note_760"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">760</span></span></a> and
        although the doctrine itself had been anticipated by Seneca and
        Plutarch, it had probably never before, and it has never since, been
        so fully realised as in the early Church. It cannot, however, be said
        that the conquest has been retained. At the present day, although the
        standard of morals is far higher than in Pagan Rome, it may be
        questioned whether the inequality of the censure which is bestowed
        upon the two sexes is not as great as in the days of Paganism, and
        that inequality is continually the cause of the most shameful and the
        most pitiable injustice. In one respect, indeed, a great
        retrogression resulted from chivalry, and long survived its decay.
        The character of the seducer, and especially of the passionless
        seducer who pursues his career simply as a kind of sport, and under
        the influence of no stronger motive than vanity or a spirit of
        adventure, has been glorified and idealised in the popular literature
        of Christendom in a manner to which we can find no parallel in
        antiquity. When we reflect that the object of such a man is by the
        coldest and most deliberate treachery to blast the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> lives of innocent women; when we compare
        the levity of his motive with the irreparable injury he inflicts; and
        when we remember that he can only deceive his victim by persuading
        her to love him, and can only ruin her by persuading her to trust
        him, it must be owned that it would be difficult to conceive a
        cruelty more wanton and more heartless, or a character combining more
        numerous elements of infamy and of dishonour. That such a character
        should for many centuries have been the popular ideal of a
        considerable section of literature, and the boast of numbers who most
        plume themselves upon their honour, is assuredly one of the most
        mournful facts in history, and it represents a moral deflection
        certainly not less than was revealed in ancient Greece by the
        position that was assigned to the courtesan.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fundamental
        truth, that the same act can never be at once venial for a man to
        demand, and infamous for a woman to accord, though nobly enforced by
        the early Christians, has not passed into the popular sentiment of
        Christendom. The mystical character, however, which the Church
        imparted to marriage has been extremely influential. Partly by
        raising it into a sacrament, and partly by representing it as, in
        some mysterious and not very definable sense, an image of the union
        of Christ with His Church, a feeling was fostered that a lifelong
        union of one man and one woman is, under all circumstances, the
        single form of intercourse between the sexes which is not
        illegitimate; and this conviction has acquired the force of a primal
        moral intuition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There can, I
        think, be little doubt that, in the stringency with which it is
        usually laid down, it rests not upon the law of nature, but upon
        positive law, although unassisted nature is sufficient to lead men
        many steps in its direction. Considering the subject simply in the
        light of unaided reason, two rules comprise the whole duty of man. He
        must abstain from whatever injures happiness or degrades character.

        act. He must consider how his partner will be affected by the union,
        the light in which society will view the connection, the probable
        position of the children to be born, the effect of these births, and
        also the effect of his example upon the well-being of society at
        large. Some of the elements of this calculation vary in different
        stages of society. Thus, public opinion in one age will reprobate,
        and therefore punish, connections which, in another age, are fully
        sanctioned; and the probable position of the children, as well as the
        effect of the births upon society, will depend greatly upon
        particular and national circumstances.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under the second
        head is comprised the influence of this intercourse in clouding or
        developing the moral feelings, lowering or elevating the tone of
        character, exciting or allaying the aberrations of the imagination,
        incapacitating men for pure affections or extending their range,
        making the animal part of our nature more or less predominant. We
        know, by the intuition of our moral nature, that this predominance is
        always a degraded, though it is not always an unhappy, condition. We
        also know that it is a law of our being, that powerful and beautiful
        affections, which had before been latent, are evoked in some
        particular forms of union, while other forms of union are peculiarly
        fitted to deaden the affections and to pervert the character.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
        considerations we have ample grounds for maintaining that the
        lifelong union of one man and of one woman should be the normal or
        dominant type of intercourse between the sexes. We can prove that it
        is on the whole most conducive to the happiness, and also to the
        moral elevation, of all parties. But beyond this point it would, I
        conceive, be impossible to advance, except by the assistance of a
        special revelation. It by no means follows that because this should
        be the dominant type it should be the only one, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or that the interests of society demand
        that all connections should be forced into the same die. Connections,
        which were confessedly only for a few years, have always subsisted
        side by side with permanent marriages; and in periods when public
        opinion, acquiescing in their propriety, inflicts no excommunication
        on one or both of the partners, when these partners are not living
        the demoralising and degrading life which accompanies the
        consciousness of guilt, and when proper provision is made for the
        children who are born, it would be, I believe, impossible to prove,
        by the light of simple and unassisted reason, that such connections
        should be invariably condemned. It is extremely important, both for
        the happiness and for the moral well-being of men, that lifelong
        unions should not be effected simply under the imperious prompting of
        a blind appetite. There are always multitudes who, in the period of
        their lives when their passions are most strong, are incapable of
        supporting children in their own social rank, and who would therefore
        injure society by marrying in it, but are nevertheless perfectly
        capable of securing an honourable career for their illegitimate
        children in the lower social sphere to which these would naturally
        belong. Under the conditions I have mentioned, these connections are
        not injurious, but beneficial, to the weaker partner; they soften the
        differences of rank, they stimulate social habits, and they do not
        produce upon character the degrading effect of promiscuous
        intercourse, or upon society the injurious effects of imprudent
        marriages, one or other of which will multiply in their absence. In
        the immense variety of circumstances and characters, cases will
        always appear in which, on utilitarian grounds, they might seem
        advisable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is necessary to
        dwell upon such considerations as these, if we would understand the
        legislation of the Pagan Empire or the changes that were effected by
        Christianity. The legislators of the Empire distinctly recognised
        these connections, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg
        350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        made it a main object to authorise, dignify, and regulate them. The
        unlimited licence of divorce practically included them under the name
        of marriage, while that name sheltered them from stigma, and
        prevented many of the gravest evils of unauthorised unions. The word
        concubine also, which in the Republic had the same signification as
        among ourselves, represented in the Empire a strictly legal union—an
        innovation which was chiefly due to Augustus, and was doubtless
        intended as part of the legislation against celibacy, and also, it
        may be, as a corrective of the licentious habits that were general.
        This union was in essentials merely a form of marriage, for he who,
        having a concubine, took to himself either a wife or another
        concubine, was legally guilty of adultery. Like the commonest form of
        marriage, it was consummated without any ceremony, and was dissoluble
        at will. Its peculiarities were that it was contracted between men of
        patrician rank and freedwomen, who were forbidden by law to
        intermarry; that the concubine, though her position was perfectly
        recognised and honourable, did not share the rank of her partner,
        that she brought no dowry, and that her children followed her rank,
        and were excluded from the rank and the inheritance of their
        father.<a id="noteref_761" name="noteref_761" href=
        "#note_761"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Against these
        notions Christianity declared a direct and implacable warfare, which
        was imperfectly reflected in the civil legislation, but appeared
        unequivocally in the writings of the Fathers, and in most of the
        decrees of the Councils.<a id="noteref_762" name="noteref_762" href=
        "#note_762"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351"
        id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> It taught, as a religious
        dogma, invariable, inflexible, and independent of all utilitarian
        calculations, that all forms of intercourse of the sexes, other than
        lifelong unions, were criminal. By teaching men to regard this
        doctrine as axiomatic, and therefore inflicting severe social
        penalties and deep degradation on transient connections, it has
        profoundly modified even their utilitarian aspect, and has rendered
        them in most countries furtive and disguised. There is probably no
        other branch of ethics which has been so largely determined by
        special dogmatic theology, and there is none which would be so deeply
        affected by its decay.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As a part of the
        same movement, the purely civil marriage of the later Pagan Empire
        was gradually replaced by religious marriages. There is a manifest
        propriety in invoking a divine benediction upon an act which forms so
        important an epoch in life, and the mingling of a religious ceremony
        impresses a deeper sense of the solemnity of the contract. The
        essentially religious and even mystical character imparted by
        Christianity to marriage rendered the consecration peculiarly
        natural, but it was only very gradually that it came to be looked
        upon as absolutely necessary. As I have already noticed, it was long
        dispensed with in the marriage of slaves; and even in the case of
        freemen, though generally performed, it was not made compulsory till
        the tenth century.<a id="noteref_763" name="noteref_763" href=
        "#note_763"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">763</span></span></a> In
        addition to its primary object of sanctifying marriage, it became in
        time a powerful <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg
        352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        instrument in securing the authority of the priesthood, who were able
        to compel men to submit to the conditions they imposed in the
        formation of the most important contract of life; and the modern
        authorisation of civil marriages, by diminishing greatly the power of
        the Catholic priesthood over domestic life, has been one of the most
        severe blows ecclesiastical influence has undergone.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The absolute
        sinfulness of divorce was at the same time strenuously maintained by
        the Councils, which in this, as in many other points, differed widely
        from the civil law. Constantine restricted it to three cases of crime
        on the part of the husband, and three on the part of the wife; but
        the habits of the people were too strong for his enactments, and,
        after one or two changes in the law, the full latitude of divorce
        reappeared in the Justinian Code. The Fathers, on the other hand,
        though they hesitated a little about the case of a divorce which
        followed an act of adultery on the part of the wife,<a id=
        "noteref_764" name="noteref_764" href="#note_764"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">764</span></span></a> had no
        hesitation whatever in pronouncing all other divorces to be criminal,
        and periods of penitential discipline were imposed upon Christians
        who availed themselves of the privileges of the civil law.<a id=
        "noteref_765" name="noteref_765" href="#note_765"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">765</span></span></a> For
        many centuries this duality of legislation continued. The barbarian
        laws restricted divorce by imposing severe fines on those who
        repudiated their wives. Charlemagne pronounced divorce to be
        criminal, but did not venture to make it penal, and he practised it
        himself. On the other hand, the Church threatened with
        excommunication, and in some cases actually launched its thunders
        against, those who were guilty of it. It was only in the twelfth
        century that the victory was <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> definitely achieved, and the civil law,
        adopting the principle of the canon law, prohibited all
        divorce.<a id="noteref_766" name="noteref_766" href=
        "#note_766"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I do not propose
        in the present work to examine how far this total prohibition has
        been for the happiness or the moral well-being of men. I will simply
        observe that, though it is now often defended, it was not originally
        imposed in Christian nations, upon utilitarian grounds, but was based
        upon the sacramental character of marriage, upon the belief that
        marriage is the special symbol of the perpetual union of Christ with
        His Church, and upon a well-known passage in the Gospels. The
        stringency of the Catholic doctrine, which forbids the dissolution of
        marriage even in the case of adultery, has been considerably relaxed
        by modern legislation, and there can, I think, be little doubt that
        further steps will yet be taken in the same direction; but the vast
        change that was effected in both practice and theory since the
        unlimited licence of the Pagan Empire must be manifest to all.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was essential,
        or at least very important, that a union which was so solemn and so
        irrevocable should be freely contracted. The sentiment of the Roman
        patriots towards the close of the Republic was that marriage should
        be regarded as a means of providing children for the State, and
        should be entered into as a matter of duty with that view, and the
        laws of Augustus had imposed many disqualifications on those who
        abstained from it. Both of these inducements to marriage passed away
        under the influence of Christianity. The popular sentiment
        disappeared with the decline of civic virtues. The laws were
        rescinded under the influence of the ascetic enthusiasm which made
        men regard the state of celibacy as pre-eminently holy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was still
        one other important condition to be attained by theologians in order
        to realise their ideal type of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> marriage. It was to prevent the members of the
        Church from intermarrying with those whose religious opinions
        differed from their own. Mixed marriages, it has been truly said, may
        do more than almost any other influence to assuage the rancour and
        the asperity of sects, but it must be added that a considerable
        measure of tolerance must have been already attained before they
        become possible. In a union in which each partner believes and
        realises that the other is doomed to an eternity of misery there can
        be no real happiness, no sympathy, no trust; and a domestic agreement
        that some of the children should be educated in one religion and some
        in the other would be impossible when each parent believed it to be
        an agreement that some children should be doomed to hell.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The domestic
        unhappiness arising from differences of belief was probably almost or
        altogether unknown in the world before the introduction of
        Christianity; for, although differences of opinion may have before
        existed, the same momentous consequences were not attached to them.
        It has been the especial bane of periods of great religious change,
        such as the conversion of the Roman Empire, or the Reformation, or
        our own day when far more serious questions than those which agitated
        the sixteenth century are occupying the attention of a large
        proportion of thinkers and scholars, and when the deep and widening
        chasm between the religious opinions of most highly educated men, and
        of the immense majority of women, is painfully apparent. While a
        multitude of scientific discoveries, critical and historical
        researches, and educational reforms have brought thinking men face to
        face with religious problems of extreme importance, women have been
        almost absolutely excluded from their influence. Their minds are
        usually by nature less capable than those of men of impartiality and
        suspense, and the almost complete omission from female education of
        those studies which most discipline and strengthen the intellect
        increases the difference, while at <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the same time it has been usually made a main
        object to imbue them with a passionate faith in traditional opinions,
        and to preserve them from all contact with opposing views. But
        contracted knowledge and imperfect sympathy are not the sole fruits
        of this education. It has always been the peculiarity of a certain
        kind of theological teaching that it inverts all the normal
        principles of judgment, and absolutely destroys intellectual
        diffidence. On other subjects we find, if not a respect for honest
        conviction, at least some sense of the amount of knowledge that is
        requisite to entitle men to express an opinion on grave
        controversies. A complete ignorance of the subject-matter of a
        dispute restrains the confidence of dogmatism; and an ignorant
        person, who is aware that, by much reading and thinking in spheres of
        which he has himself no knowledge, his educated neighbour has
        modified or rejected opinions which that ignorant person had been
        taught, will, at least if he is a man of sense or modesty, abstain
        from compassionating the benighted condition of his more instructed
        friend. But on theological questions this has never been so.
        Unfaltering belief being taught as the first of duties, and all doubt
        being usually stigmatised as criminal or damnable, a state of mind is
        formed to which we find no parallel in other fields. Many men and
        most women, though completely ignorant of the very rudiments of
        biblical criticism, historical research, or scientific discoveries,
        though they have never read a single page, or understood a single
        proposition of the writings of those whom they condemn, and have
        absolutely no rational knowledge either of the arguments by which
        their faith is defended, or of those by which it has been impugned,
        will nevertheless adjudicate with the utmost confidence upon every
        polemical question; denounce, hate, pity, or pray for the conversion
        of all who dissent from what they have been taught; assume, as a
        matter beyond the faintest possibility of doubt, that the opinions
        they have received without enquiry <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> must be true, and that the opinions which
        others have arrived at by enquiry must be false, and make it a main
        object of their lives to assail what they call heresy in every way in
        their power, except by examining the grounds on which it rests. It is
        probable that the great majority of voices that swell the clamour
        against every book which is regarded as heretical are the voices of
        those who would deem it criminal even to open that book, or to enter
        into any real, searching, and impartial investigation of the subject
        to which it relates. Innumerable pulpits support this tone of
        thought, and represent, with a fervid rhetoric well fitted to excite
        the nerves and imaginations of women, the deplorable condition of all
        who deviate from a certain type of opinions or of emotions; a blind
        propagandism or a secret wretchedness penetrates into countless
        households, poisoning the peace of families, chilling the mutual
        confidence of husband and wife, adding immeasurably to the
        difficulties which every searcher into truth has to encounter, and
        diffusing far and wide intellectual timidity, disingenuousness, and
        hypocrisy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These domestic
        divisions became very apparent in the period of the conversion of the
        Roman Empire; and a natural desire to guard intact the orthodoxy and
        zeal of the converts, and to prevent a continual discordance,
        stimulated the Fathers in their very vehement denunciations of all
        mixed marriages. We may also trace in these denunciations the outline
        of a very singular doctrine, which was afterwards suffered to fall
        into obscurity, but was revived in the last century in England in a
        curious and learned work of the nonjuror Dodwell.<a id="noteref_767"

        image was not regarded as a mere metaphor or comparison, but as
        intimating a mysterious unity, which, though not susceptible of any
        very clear definition, was not on that account the less real.
        Christians were the <span class="tei tei-q">“limbs of Christ,”</span>
        and for them to join themselves in marriage with those who were not
        of the Christian fold was literally, it was said, a species of
        adultery or fornication. The intermarriage of the Israelites, the
        chosen seed of the ancient world, with the Gentiles, had been

        the opinion of some, at least, of the Fathers, the Christian
        community occupied towards the unbelievers a position analogous to
        that which the Jews had occupied towards the Gentiles. St. Cyprian
        denounced the crime of those <span class="tei tei-q">“who prostitute

        sanctity attributed to virginity, the absolute condemnation of all
        forms of sexual connection other than marriage, and the formation and
        gradual realisation of the Christian conception of marriage as a
        permanent union of a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg

        and woman of the same religious opinions, consecrated by solemn
        religious services, carrying with it a deep religious signification,
        and dissoluble only by death, were the most obvious signs of
        Christian influence in the sphere of ethics we are examining. Another
        very important result of the new religion was to raise to a far
        greater honour than they had previously possessed, the qualities in

        curious subjects of enquiry than the distinctive differences between
        the sexes, and the manner in which those differences have affected
        the ideal types of different ages, nations, philosophies, and
        religions. Physically, men have the indisputable superiority in
        strength, and women in beauty. Intellectually, a certain inferiority
        of the female sex can hardly be denied when we remember how almost
        exclusively the foremost places in every department of science,
        literature, and art have been occupied by men, how infinitesimally
        small is the number of women who have shown in any form the very
        highest order of genius, how many of the greatest men have achieved
        their greatness in defiance of the most adverse circumstances, and
        how completely women have failed in obtaining the first position,
        even in music or painting, for the cultivation of which their
        circumstances would appear most propitious. It is as impossible to
        find a female Raphael, or a female Handel, as a female Shakspeare or
        Newton. Women are intellectually more desultory and volatile than
        men; they are more occupied with particular instances than with
        general principles; they judge rather by intuitive perceptions than
        by deliberate reasoning or past experience. They are, however,
        usually superior to men in nimbleness and rapidity of thought, and in
        the gift of tact or the power of seizing speedily and faithfully the
        finer inflexions of feeling, and they have therefore often attained
        very great eminence in conversation, as letter-writers, as actresses,
        and as novelists.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Morally, the
        general superiority of women over men, is, I think, unquestionable.
        If we take the somewhat coarse and inadequate criterion of police
        statistics, we find that, while the male and female populations are
        nearly the same in number, the crimes committed by men are usually
        rather more than five times as numerous as those committed by
        women;<a id="noteref_772" name="noteref_772" href=
        "#note_772"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">772</span></span></a> and
        although it may be justly observed that men, as the stronger sex, and
        the sex upon whom the burden of supporting the family is thrown, have
        more temptations than women, it must be remembered, on the other
        hand, that extreme poverty which verges upon starvation is most
        common among women, whose means of livelihood are most restricted,
        and whose earnings are smallest and most precarious. Self-sacrifice
        is the most conspicuous element of a virtuous and religious
        character, and it is certainly far less common among men than among
        women, whose whole lives are usually spent in yielding to the will
        and consulting the pleasures of another. There are two great
        departments of virtue: the impulsive, or that which springs
        spontaneously from the emotions; and the deliberative, or that which
        is performed in obedience to the sense of duty; and in both of these
        I imagine women are superior to men. Their sensibility is greater,
        they are more chaste both in thought and act, more tender to the
        erring, more compassionate to the suffering, more affectionate to all
        about them. On the other hand, those who have traced the course of
        the wives of the poor, and of many who, though in narrow
        circumstances, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg
        360]</span><a name="Pg360" id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> can
        hardly be called poor, will probably admit that in no other class do
        we so often find entire lives spent in daily persistent self-denial,
        in the patient endurance of countless trials, in the ceaseless and
        deliberate sacrifice of their own enjoyments to the well-being or the
        prospects of others. Women, however, though less prone than men to
        intemperance and brutality, are in general more addicted to the petty
        forms of vanity, jealousy, spitefulness, and ambition, and they are
        also inferior to men in active courage. In the courage of endurance
        they are commonly superior; but their passive courage is not so much
        fortitude which bears and defies, as resignation which bears and
        bends. In the ethics of intellect they are decidedly inferior. To
        repeat an expression I have already employed, women very rarely love
        truth, though they love passionately what they call <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the truth,”</span> or opinions they have received from
        others, and hate vehemently those who differ from them. They are
        little capable of impartiality or of doubt; their thinking is chiefly
        a mode of feeling; though very generous in their acts, they are
        rarely generous in their opinions or in their judgments. They
        persuade rather than convince, and value belief rather as a source of
        consolation than as a faithful expression of the reality of things.
        They are less capable than men of perceiving qualifying
        circumstances, of admitting the existence of elements of good in
        systems to which they are opposed, of distinguishing the personal
        character of an opponent from the opinions he maintains. Men lean
        most to justice and women to mercy. Men excel in energy,
        self-reliance, perseverance, and magnanimity; women in humility,
        gentleness, modesty, and endurance. The realising imagination which
        causes us to pity and to love is more sensitive in women than in men,
        and it is especially more capable of dwelling on the unseen. Their
        religious or devotional realisations are incontestably more vivid;
        and it is probable that, while a father is most moved by the death of
        a child in his presence, a mother <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> generally feels most the death of a child in
        some distant land. But, though more intense, the sympathies of women
        are commonly less wide than those of men. Their imaginations
        individualise more; their affections are, in consequence,
        concentrated rather on leaders than on causes; and if they care for a
        great cause, it is generally because it is represented by a great
        man, or connected with some one whom they love. In politics, their
        enthusiasm is more naturally loyalty than patriotism. In history,
        they are even more inclined than men to dwell exclusively upon
        biographical incidents or characteristics as distinguished from the
        march of general causes. In benevolence, they excel in charity, which
        alleviates individual suffering, rather than in philanthropy, which
        deals with large masses and is more frequently employed in preventing
        than in allaying calamity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a remark of
        Winckelmann that <span class="tei tei-q">“the supreme beauty of Greek
        art is rather male than female;”</span> and the justice of this
        remark has been amply corroborated by the greater knowledge we have
        of late years attained of the works of the Phidian period, in which
        art achieved its highest perfection, and in which, at the same time,
        force and freedom, and masculine grandeur, were its pre-eminent
        characteristics. A similar observation may be made of the moral ideal
        of which ancient art was simply the expression. In antiquity the
        virtues that were most admired were almost exclusively those which
        are distinctively masculine. Courage, self-assertion, magnanimity,
        and, above all, patriotism, were the leading features of the ideal
        type; and chastity, modesty, and charity, the gentler and the
        domestic virtues, which are especially feminine, were greatly
        undervalued. With the single exception of conjugal fidelity, none of
        the virtues that were very highly prized were virtues distinctively
        or pre-eminently feminine. With this exception, nearly all the most
        illustrious women of antiquity were illustrious chiefly because they
        overcame the natural conditions of their sex. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> It is a characteristic fact that the
        favourite female ideal of the artists appears to have been the
        Amazon.<a id="noteref_773" name="noteref_773" href=
        "#note_773"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">773</span></span></a> We may
        admire the Spartan mother, and the mother of the Gracchi, repressing
        every sign of grief when their children were sacrificed upon the
        altar of their country, we may wonder at the majestic courage of a
        Porcia and an Arria; but we extol them chiefly because, being women,
        they emancipated themselves from the frailty of their sex, and
        displayed an heroic fortitude worthy of the strongest and the bravest
        of men. We may bestow an equal admiration upon the noble devotion and
        charity of a St. Elizabeth of Hungary, or of a Mrs. Fry, but we do
        not admire them because they displayed these virtues, although they
        were women, for we feel that their virtues were of the kind which the
        female nature is most fitted to produce. The change from the heroic
        to the saintly ideal, from the ideal of Paganism to the ideal of
        Christianity, was a change from a type which was essentially male to
        one which was essentially feminine. Of all the great schools of
        philosophy no other reflected so faithfully the Roman conception of
        moral excellence as Stoicism, and the greatest Roman exponent of
        Stoicism summed up its character in a single sentence when he
        pronounced it to be beyond all other sects the most emphatically
        masculine.<a id="noteref_774" name="noteref_774" href=
        "#note_774"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">774</span></span></a> On the
        other hand, an ideal type in which meekness, gentleness, patience,
        humility, faith, and love are the most prominent features, is not
        naturally male but female. A reason probably deeper than the
        historical ones which are commonly alleged, why sculpture has always
        been peculiarly Pagan and painting peculiarly Christian, may be found
        in the fact, that sculpture is especially suited to represent male
        beauty, or the beauty of strength, and painting female beauty, or the
        beauty of softness; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg
        363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        that Pagan sentiment was chiefly a glorification of the masculine
        qualities of strength, and courage, and conscious virtue, while
        Christian sentiment is chiefly a glorification of the feminine
        qualities of gentleness, humility, and love. The painters whom the
        religious feeling of Christendom has recognised as the most faithful
        exponents of Christian sentiment have always been those who infused a
        large measure of feminine beauty even into their male characters; and
        we never, or scarcely ever, find that the same artist has been
        conspicuously successful in delineating both Christian and Pagan
        types. Michael Angelo, whose genius loved to expatiate on the
        sublimity of strength and defiance, failed signally in his
        representations of the Christian ideal; and Perugino was equally
        unsuccessful when he sought to pourtray the features of the heroes of
        antiquity.<a id="noteref_775" name="noteref_775" href=
        "#note_775"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">775</span></span></a> The
        position that was gradually assigned to the Virgin as the female
        ideal in the belief and the devotion of Christendom, was a
        consecration or an expression of the new value that was attached to
        the feminine virtues.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general
        superiority of women to men in the strength of their religious
        emotions, and their natural attraction to a religion which made
        personal attachment to its Founder its central duty, and which
        imparted an unprecedented dignity and afforded an unprecedented scope
        to their characteristic virtues, account for the very conspicuous
        position that female influence assumed in the great work of the
        conversion of the Roman Empire. In no other important movement of
        thought was it so powerful or so acknowledged. In the ages of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name="Pg364"
        id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> persecution female figures
        occupy many of the foremost places in the ranks of martyrdom, and
        Pagan and Christian writers alike attest the alacrity with which
        women flocked to the Church, and the influence they exercised in its
        favour over the male members of their families. The mothers of St.
        Augustine, St. Chrysostom, St. Basil, St. Gregory Nazianzen, and
        Theodoret, had all a leading part in the conversion of their sons.
        St. Helena, the mother of Constantine, Flacilla, the wife of
        Theodosius the Great, St. Pulcheria, the sister of Theodosius the
        Younger, and Placidia, the mother of Valentinian III., were among the
        most conspicuous defenders of the faith. In the heretical sects the
        same zeal was manifested, and Arius, Priscillian, and Montanus were
        all supported by troops of zealous female devotees. In the career of
        asceticism women took a part little if at all inferior to men, while
        in the organisation of the great work of charity they were
        pre-eminent. For no other field of active labour are women so
        admirably suited as for this; and although we may trace from the
        earliest period, in many creeds and ages, individual instances of
        their influence in allaying the sufferings of the distressed,<a id=
        "noteref_776" name="noteref_776" href="#note_776"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> be truly said that their
        instinct and genius of charity had never before the dawn of
        Christianity obtained full scope for action. Fabiola, Paula, Melania,
        and a host of other noble ladies devoted their time and fortunes
        mainly to founding and extending vast institutions of charity, some
        of them of a kind before unknown in the world. The Empress Flacilla
        was accustomed to tend with her own hands the sick in the
        hospitals,<a id="noteref_777" name="noteref_777" href=
        "#note_777"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">777</span></span></a> and a
        readiness to discharge such offices was deemed the first duty of a
        Christian wife.<a id="noteref_778" name="noteref_778" href=
        "#note_778"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">778</span></span></a> From
        age to age the impulse thus communicated has been felt. There has
        been no period, however corrupt, there has been no Church, however
        superstitious, that has not been adorned by many Christian women
        devoting their entire lives to assuaging the sufferings of men; and
        the mission of charity thus instituted has not been more efficacious
        in diminishing the sum of human wretchedness, than in promoting the
        moral dignity of those by whom it was conducted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
        Collyridian heretics, women were admitted to the priesthood. Among
        the orthodox, although this honour was not bestowed upon them, they
        received a religious consecration, and discharged some minor
        ecclesiastical functions under the name of deaconesses.<a id=
        "noteref_779" name="noteref_779" href="#note_779"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">779</span></span></a> This
        order may be traced to the Apostolic period.<a id="noteref_780" name=
        "noteref_780" href="#note_780"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        consisted of elderly virgins, who were set apart by a formal
        ordination, and were employed in assisting as catechists and
        attendants at the baptism of women, in visiting the sick, ministering
        to martyrs <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg
        366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in
        prison, preserving order in the congregations, and accompanying and
        presenting women who desired an interview with the bishop. It would
        appear, from the evidence of some councils, that abuses gradually
        crept into this institution, and the deaconesses at last faded into
        simple nuns, but they were still in existence in the East in the
        twelfth century. Besides these, widows, when they had been but once
        married, were treated with peculiar honour, and were made the special
        recipients of the charity of the Church. Women advanced in years,
        who, either from their single life or from bereavement, have been
        left without any male protector in the world, have always been
        peculiarly deserving of commiseration. With less strength, and
        commonly with less means, and less knowledge of the world than men,
        they are liable to contract certain peculiarities of mind and manner
        to which an excessive amount of ridicule has been attached, and age
        in most cases furnishes them with very little to compensate for the
        charms of which it has deprived them. The weight and dignity of
        matured wisdom, which make the old age of one sex so venerable, are
        more rarely found in that of the other, and even physical beauty is
        more frequently the characteristic of an old man than of an old
        woman. The Church laboured steadily to cast a halo of reverence
        around this period of woman's life, and its religious exercises have
        done very much to console and to occupy it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In accordance with
        these ideas, the Christian legislators contributed largely to improve
        the legal position of widows in respect to property,<a id=
        "noteref_781" name="noteref_781" href="#note_781"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">781</span></span></a> and
        Justinian gave mothers the guardianship <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of their children, destroying the Pagan rule
        that guardianship could only be legally exercised by men.<a id=
        "noteref_782" name="noteref_782" href="#note_782"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">782</span></span></a> The
        usual subservience of the sex to ecclesiastical influence, the
        numerous instances of rich widows devoting their fortunes, and
        mothers their sons, to the Church, had no doubt some influence in
        securing the advocacy of the clergy; but these measures had a
        manifest importance in elevating the position of women who have had,
        in Christian lands, a great, though not, I think, altogether a
        beneficial influence, in the early education of their sons.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Independently of
        all legal enactments, the simple change of the ideal type by bringing
        specially feminine virtues into the forefront was sufficient to
        elevate and ennoble the sex. The commanding position of the mediæval
        abbesses, the great number of female saints, and especially the
        reverence bestowed upon the Virgin, had a similar effect. It is
        remarkable that the Jews, who, of the three great nations of
        antiquity, certainly produced in history and poetry the smallest
        number of illustrious women, should have furnished the world with its
        supreme female ideal, and it is also a striking illustration of the
        qualities which prove most attractive in woman that one of whom we
        know nothing except her gentleness and her sorrow should have
        exercised a magnetic power upon the world incomparably greater than
        was exercised by the most majestic female patriots of Paganism.
        Whatever may be thought of its theological propriety, there can be
        little doubt that the Catholic reverence for the Virgin has done much
        to elevate and purify the ideal of woman, and to soften the manners
        of men. It has had an influence which the worship of the Pagan
        goddesses could never possess, for these had been almost destitute of
        moral beauty, and especially of that kind of moral beauty which is
        peculiarly feminine. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg
        368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> It
        supplied in a great measure the redeeming and ennobling element in
        that strange amalgam of religious, licentious, and military feeling
        which was formed around women in the age of chivalry, and which no
        succeeding change of habit or belief has wholly destroyed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It can hardly, I
        think, be questioned that in the great religious convulsions of the
        sixteenth century the feminine type followed Catholicism, while
        Protestantism inclined more to the masculine type. Catholicism alone
        retained the Virgin worship, which at once reflected and sustained
        the first. The skill with which it acts upon the emotions by music,
        and painting, and solemn architecture, and imposing pageantry, its
        tendency to appeal to the imagination rather than to the reason, and
        to foster modes of feeling rather than modes of thought, its
        assertion of absolute and infallible certainty, above all, the manner
        in which it teaches its votary to throw himself perpetually on
        authority, all tended in the same direction. It is the part of a
        woman to lean, it is the part of a man to stand. A religion which
        prescribes to the distracted mind unreasoning faith in an infallible
        Church, and to the troubled conscience an implicit trust in an
        absolving priesthood, has ever had an especial attraction to a
        feminine mind. A religion which recognises no authority between man
        and his Creator, which asserts at once the dignity and the duty of
        private judgment, and which, while deepening immeasurably the sense
        of individual responsibility, denudes religion of meretricious
        ornaments, and of most æsthetic aids, is pre-eminently a religion of
        men. Puritanism is the most masculine form that Christianity has yet
        assumed. Its most illustrious teachers differed from the Catholic
        saints as much in the moral type they displayed as in the system of
        doctrines they held. Catholicism commonly softens, while
        Protestantism strengthens, the character; but the softness of the
        first often degenerates into weakness, and the strength of the second
        into hardness. Sincerely Catholic nations are <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> distinguished for their reverence, for
        their habitual and vivid perceptions of religious things, for the
        warmth of their emotions, for a certain amiability of disposition,
        and a certain natural courtesy and refinement of manner that are
        inexpressibly winning. Sincerely Protestant nations are distinguished
        for their love of truth, for their firm sense of duty, for the
        strength and the dignity of their character. Loyalty and humility,
        which are especially feminine, flourish chiefly in the first; liberty
        and self-assertion in the second. The first are most prone to
        superstition, and the second to fanaticism. Protestantism, by
        purifying and dignifying marriage, conferred a great benefit upon
        women; but it must be owned that neither in its ideal type, nor in
        the general tenor of its doctrines or devotions, is it as congenial
        to their nature as the religion it superseded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Its complete
        suppression of the conventual system was also, I think, very far from
        a benefit to women or to the world. It would be impossible to
        conceive any institution more needed than one which would furnish a
        shelter for the many women who, from poverty, or domestic
        unhappiness, or other causes, find themselves cast alone and
        unprotected into the battle of life, which would secure them from the
        temptations to gross vice, and from the extremities of suffering, and
        would convert them into agents of active, organised, and intelligent
        charity. Such an institution would be almost free from the objections
        that may justly be urged against monasteries, which withdraw strong
        men from manual labour, and it would largely mitigate the difficulty
        of providing labour and means of livelihood for single women, which
        is one of the most pressing, in our own day one of the most
        appalling, of social problems. Most unhappily for mankind, this noble
        conception was from the first perverted. Institutions that might have
        had an incalculable philanthropic value were based upon the principle
        of asceticism, which makes the sacrifice, not the promotion, of
        earthly happiness its aim, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370" id="Pg370" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> binding vows produced much misery and not a
        little vice. The convent became the perpetual prison of the daughter
        whom a father was disinclined to endow, or of young girls who, under
        the impulse of a transient enthusiasm, or of a transient sorrow, took
        a step which they never could retrace, and useless penances and
        contemptible superstitions wasted the energies that might have been
        most beneficially employed. Still it is very doubtful whether, even
        in the most degraded period, the convents did not prevent more misery
        than they inflicted, and in the Sisters of Charity the religious
        orders of Catholicism have produced one of the most perfect of all
        the types of womanhood. There is, as I conceive, no fact in modern
        history more deeply to be deplored than that the Reformers, who in
        matters of doctrinal innovations were often so timid, should have
        levelled to the dust, instead of attempting to regenerate, the whole
        conventual system of Catholicism.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The course of
        these observations has led me to transgress the limits assigned to
        this history. It has been, however, my object through this entire
        work to exhibit not only the nature but also the significance of the
        moral facts I have recorded, by showing how they have affected the
        subsequent changes of society. I will conclude this chapter, and this
        work, by observing that of all the departments of ethics the
        questions concerning the relations of the sexes and the proper
        position of women are those upon the future of which there rests the
        greatest uncertainty. History tells us that, as civilisation
        advances, the charity of men becomes at once warmer and more
        expansive, their habitual conduct both more gentle and more
        temperate, and their love of truth more sincere; but it also warns us
        that in periods of great intellectual enlightenment, and of great
        social refinement, the relations of the sexes have often been most
        anarchical. It is impossible to deny that the form which these
        relations at present assume has been very largely affected by special
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371"
        id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> religious teaching, which, for
        good or for ill, is rapidly waning in the sphere of government, and
        also, that certain recent revolutions in economical opinion and
        industrial enterprise have a most profound bearing upon the subject.
        The belief that a rapid increase of population is always eminently
        beneficial, which was long accepted as an axiom by both statesmen and
        moralists, and was made the basis of a large part of the legislation
        of the first and of the decisions of the second, has now been
        replaced by the directly opposite doctrine, that the very highest
        interest of society is not to stimulate but to restrain
        multiplication, diminishing the number of marriages and of children.
        In consequence of this belief, and of the many factitious wants that
        accompany a luxurious civilisation, a very large and increasing
        proportion of women are left to make their way in life without any
        male protector, and the difficulties they have to encounter through
        physical weakness have been most unnaturally and most fearfully
        aggravated by laws and customs which, resting on the old assumption
        that every woman should be a wife, habitually deprive them of the
        pecuniary and educational advantages of men, exclude them absolutely
        from very many of the employments in which they might earn a
        subsistence, encumber their course in others by a heartless ridicule
        or by a steady disapprobation, and consign, in consequence, many
        thousands to the most extreme and agonising poverty, and perhaps a
        still larger number to the paths of vice. At the same time a
        momentous revolution, the effects of which can as yet be but
        imperfectly descried, has taken place in the chief spheres of female
        industry that remain. The progress of machinery has destroyed its
        domestic character. The distaff has fallen from the hand. The needle
        is being rapidly superseded, and the work which, from the days of
        Homer to the present century, was accomplished in the centre of the
        family, has been transferred to the crowded manufactory.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The probable
        consequences of these things are among the most important questions
        that can occupy the moralist or the philanthropist, but they do not
        fall within the province of the historian. That the pursuits and
        education of women will be considerably altered, that these
        alterations will bring with them some modifications of the type of
        character, and that the prevailing moral notions concerning the
        relations of the sexes will be subjected in many quarters to a severe
        and hostile criticism, may safely be predicted. Many wild theories
        will doubtless be propounded. Some real ethical changes may perhaps
        be effected, but these, if I mistake not, can only be within definite
        and narrow limits. He who will seriously reflect upon our clear
        perceptions of the difference between purity and impurity, upon the
        laws that govern our affections, and upon the interests of the
        children who are born, may easily convince himself that in this, as
        in all other spheres, there are certain eternal moral landmarks which
        never can be removed.</p>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">It must not; however, be inferred from
          this that infanticide increases in direct proportion to the
          unchastity of a nation. Probably the condition of civilised society
          in which it is most common, is where a large amount of actual
          unchastity coexists with very strong social condemnation of the
          sinner, and where, in consequence, there is an intense anxiety to
          conceal the fall. A recent writer on Spain has noticed the almost
          complete absence of infanticide in that country, and has ascribed
          it to the great leniency of public opinion towards female frailty.
          Foundling hospitals, also, greatly influence the history of
          infanticide; but the mortality in them was long so great that it
          may be questioned whether they have diminished the number of the
          deaths, though they have, as I believe, greatly diminished the
          number of the murders of children. Lord Kames, writing in the last
          half of the eighteenth century, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“In
          Wales, even at present, and in the Highlands of Scotland, it is
          scarce a disgrace for a young woman to have a bastard. In the
          country last mentioned, the first instance known of a bastard child
          being destroyed by its mother through shame is a late one. The
          virtue of chastity appears to be thus gaining ground, as the only
          temptation a woman can have to destroy her child is to conceal her
          frailty.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          These words have given rise to a famous controversy between two
          Dutch professors, named Noodt and Bynkershoek, conducted on both
          sides with great learning, and on the side of Noodt with great
          passion. Noodt maintained that these words are simply the
          expression of a moral truth, not a judicial decision, and that
          exposition was never illegal in Rome till some time after the
          establishment of Christianity. His opponent argued that exposition
          was legally identical with infanticide, and became, therefore,
          illegal when the power of life and death was withdrawn from the
          father. (See the works of Noodt (Cologne, 1763) and of Bynkershoek
          (Cologne, 1761)). It was at least certain that exposition was
          notorious and avowed, and the law against it, if it existed,
          inoperative. Gibbon (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          represents Chremes as having, as a matter of course, charged his
          pregnant wife to have her child killed provided it was a girl. The
          mother, overcome by pity, shrank from doing so, and secretly gave
          it to an old woman to expose it, in hopes that it might be
          preserved. Chremes, on hearing what had been done, reproached his
          wife for her womanly pity, and told her she had been not only
          disobedient but irrational, for she was only consigning her
          daughter to the life of a prostitute. In Apuleius (<span class=

          not bring herself to do. The girl was brought up secretly. In the

          Act. iv. Scene 5. See, too, Suet. <span class=

          lxv. According to Suetonius (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Calig.</span></span> v.), on the death of
          Germanicus, women exposed their new-born children in sign of grief.
          Ovid had dwelt with much feeling on the barbarity of these
          practices. It is a very curious fact, which has been noticed by
          Warburton, that Chremes, whose sentiments about infants we have
          just seen, is the very personage into whose mouth Terence has put
          the famous sentiment, <span class="tei tei-q">“Homo sum, humani
          nihil a me alienum puto.”</span></dd>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">That these were the usual fates of
          exposed infants is noticed by several writers. Some, too, both

          liability to incestuous marriages resulting from frequent
          exposition. In the Greek poets there are several allusions to rich
          childless men adopting foundlings, and Juvenal says it was common
          for Roman wives to palm off foundlings on their husbands for their
          sons. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          exposed children who were said to have been maimed and mutilated,
          either to prevent their recognition by their parents, or that they
          might gain money as beggars for their masters.</dd>

          of a murder, fled to him. He brought both the accused and accusers
          to the tomb of the murdered man, and asked him whether the prisoner
          was the murderer. The corpse answered in the negative; the

          à cette humanité cruelle qui les enhardissoit au mal, ils
          infligèrent peine de mort contre l'inceste, le vol et le meurtre
          qui jusques-là n'avoient été punis que par l'exil, ou dont on se

          Roman emperors settled barbarian prisoners to cultivate the desert

          think, justly divides the history of asceticism into three periods.
          During the first, which extends from the foundation of the Church
          to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 250, there were men
          and women who, with a view to spiritual perfection, abstained from
          marriage, relinquished amusements, accustomed themselves to severe
          fasts, and gave up their property to works of charity; but did this
          in the middle of society and without leading the life of either a
          hermit or a monk. During the second period, which extended from the
          Decian persecution, anchorites were numerous, but the custom of a
          common or cœnobitic life was unknown. It was originated in the time
          of Constantine by Pachomius.</dd>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An Irish
            saint, named Coemgenus, is said to have shown his devotion in a
            way which was directly opposite to that of the other saints I
            have mentioned—by his special use of cold water—but the principle
            in each case was the same—to mortify nature. St. Coemgenus was
            accustomed to pray for an hour every night in a pool of cold
            water, while the devil sent a horrible beast to swim round him.
            An angel, however, was sent to him for three purposes.

          this in St. Arsenius. His eyelashes are said to have fallen off
          through continual weeping, and he had always, when at work, to put
          a cloth on his breast to receive his tears. As he felt his death
          approaching, his terror rose to the point of agony. The monks who
          were about him said, <span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class=

          which Christ does not seem to have known. Mr. Buckle has collected
          a series of passages to precisely the same effect from the writings

          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          in which the forms of dancing-girls appeared to surround him as he

          Patrum</span></span>, ch. xix.) was especially tortured by the
          recollection of the songs she had sung when young, which
          continually haunted her mind. St. Hilarion (see his <span class=

          St. Jerome) thought he saw a gladiatorial show while he was

          S. Pemen demeuroit en Egypte avec ses frères, leur mère, qui avoit
          un extrême désir de les voir, venoit souvent au lieu où ils
          estoient, sans pouvoir jamais avoir cette satisfaction. Une fois
          enfin elle prit si bien son temps qu'elle les rencontra qui
          alloient à l'église, mais dès qu'ils la virent ils s'en
          retournèrent en haste dans leur cellule et fermèrent la porte sur
          eux. Elle les suivit, et trouvant la porte, elle les appeloit avec
          des larmes et des cris capables de les toucher de compassion....
          Pemen s'y leva et s'y en alla, et l'entendant pleurer il luy dit,
          tenant toujours la porte fermée, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Pourquoi
          vous lassez-vous inutilement à pleurer et crier? N'êtes-vous pas
          déjà assez abattue par la vieillesse?’</span> Elle reconnut la voix
          de Pemen, et s'efforçant encore davantage, elle s'écria,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘Hé, mes enfans, c'est que je voudrais bien
          vous voir: et quel mal y a-t-il que je vous voie? Ne suis-je pas

          and was about to leave in the evening, when she implored him to
          stay. He refused, and she then prayed to God, who sent so violent a
          tempest that the saint was unable to depart. (St. Greg.

          xiv. Dean Milman well says of a later period: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“According to the monastic view of Christianity, the
          total abandonment of the world, with all its ties and duties, as
          well as its treasures, its enjoyments, and objects of ambition,
          advanced rather than diminished the hopes of salvation. Why should
          they fight for a perishing world, from which it was better to be
          estranged?... It is singular, indeed, that while we have seen the
          Eastern monks turned into fierce undisciplined soldiers, perilling
          their own lives and shedding the blood of others without remorse,
          in assertion of some shadowy shade of orthodox expression, hardly
          anywhere do we find them asserting their liberties or their
          religion with intrepid resistance. Hatred of heresy was a more
          stirring motive than the dread or the danger of Islamism. After the
          first defeats the Christian mind was still further prostrated by
          the common notion that the invasion was a just and
          heaven-commissioned visitation; ... resistance a vain, almost an
          impious struggle to avert inevitable punishment.”</span>—Milman's

          think very rarely, intellectual flashes of some brilliancy. Two of
          them strike me as especially noteworthy. St. Arsenius refused to
          separate young criminals from communion though he had no hesitation
          about old men; for he had observed that young men speedily get
          accustomed and indifferent to the state of excommunication, while
          old men feel continually, and acutely, the separation. (Socrates,
          iv. 23.) St. Apollonius explained the Egyptian idolatry with the
          most intelligent rationalism. The ox, he thought, was in the first
          instance worshipped for its domestic uses; the Nile, because it was
          the chief cause of the fertility of the soil &amp;c. (Rufinus,

            a certain city in consequence of the crowing of cocks, and had in
            consequence a great hatred of that bird; 2nd, that the cocks

            representatives of Frenchmen, with whom the English were

          160.) It was, with foot-ball and several other amusements, for a

          the exhibition of plays on Thursday, because on Thursdays
          bear-baiting and suchlike pastimes had been usually practised, and
          an injunction to the same effect was sent to the Lord Mayor,
          wherein it was stated that, <span class="tei tei-q">“in divers
          places the players do use to recite their plays, to the great hurt

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          petitioning Elizabeth against Shakespeare, on the ground of his
          plays distracting men from bear-baiting. Elizabeth (see Nichols)
          was extremely fond of bear-baiting. James I. especially delighted
          in cock-fighting, and in 1610 was present at a great fight between
          a lion and a bear. (Hone, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Every Day Book</span></span>, vol. i. pp.
          255-299.) The theatres, however, rapidly multiplied, and a writer
          who lived about 1629 said, <span class="tei tei-q">“that no less
          than seventeen playhouses had been built in or about London within
          threescore years.”</span> (Seymour's <span class=

          vol. i. p. 229.) The Rebellion suppressed all public amusements,
          and when they were re-established after the Restoration, it was
          found that the tastes of the better classes no longer sympathised
          with the bear-garden. Pepys (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          of bull-baiting as <span class="tei tei-q">“a very rude and nasty
          pleasure,”</span> and says he had not been in the bear-garden for
          many years. Evelyn (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          cruelties,”</span> and says he had not visited them before for

          have no right to disturb them.”</span> In 1751, however, Lord Kames
          was able to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“The bear garden, which is
          one of the chief entertainments of the English, is held in

          sermons upon it, and the frequent riots resulting from the fact
          that the bear-gardens had become the resort of the worst classes
          assisted the movement. The London magistrates took measures to
          suppress cock-throwing in 1769 (Hampson's <span class=

          floor.... Look at my burnt and bleeding feet. Let me go off this
          burning floor for one moment, only for one single short moment....
          The fourth dungeon is the boiling kettle ... in the middle of it
          there is a boy.... His eyes are burning like two burning coals. Two
          long flames come out of his ears.... Sometimes he opens his mouth,
          and blazing fire rolls out. But listen! there is a sound like a
          kettle boiling.... The blood is boiling in the scalded veins of
          that boy. The brain is boiling and bubbling in his head. The marrow
          is boiling in his bones.... The fifth dungeon is the red-hot
          oven.... The little child is in this red-hot oven. Hear how it
          screams to come out. See how it turns and twists itself about in
          the fire. It beats its head against the roof of the oven. It stamps
          its little feet on the floor.... God was very good to this child.
          Very likely God saw it would get worse and worse, and would never
          repent, and so it would have to be punished much more in hell. So
          God in His mercy called it out of the world in its early

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">Thus, in a book which was attributed
          (it is said erroneously) to Jeremy Taylor, we find two singularly
          unrhetorical and unimpassioned chapters, deliberately enumerating
          the most atrocious acts of cruelty in human history, and
          maintaining that they are surpassed by the tortures inflicted by
          the Deity. A few instances will suffice. Certain persons
          <span class="tei tei-q">“put rings of iron, stuck full of sharp
          points of needles, about their arms and feet, in such a manner as
          the prisoners could not move without wounding themselves; then they
          compassed them about with fire, to the end that, standing still,
          they might be burnt alive, and if they stirred the sharp points
          pierced their flesh.... What, then, shall be the torment of the
          damned where they shall burn eternally without dying, and without
          possibility of removing?... Alexander, the son of Hyrcanus, caused
          eight hundred to be crucified, and whilst they were yet alive
          caused their wives and children to be murdered before their eyes,
          that so they might not die once, but many deaths. This rigour shall
          not be wanting in hell.... Mezentius tied a living body to a dead
          until the putrefied exhalations of the dead had killed the
          living.... What is this in respect of hell, when each body of the
          damned is more loathsome and unsavoury than a million of dead
          dogs?... Bonaventure says, if one of the damned were brought into
          this world it were sufficient to infect the whole earth.... We are
          amazed to think of the inhumanity of Phalaris, who roasted men
          alive in his brazen bull. That was a joy in respect of that fire of
          hell.... This torment ... comprises as many torments as the body of
          man has joints, sinews, arteries, &amp;c., being caused by that
          penetrating and real fire, of which this temporal fire is but a
          painted fire.... What comparison will there be between burning for
          a hundred years' space, and to be burning without interruption as
          long as God is God?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          the dowry, as well as of the ἕδνα, in Homer. Penelope had received
          a dowry from Icarus, her father. M. Michelet, in one of those
          fanciful books which he has recently published, maintains a view of
          the object of the ἕδνα which I do not remember to have seen
          elsewhere, and which I do not believe. He says: <span class=

            ages and religions; and I am able in this case to present the
            reader with an illustration of their permanence, which I think
            somewhat remarkable. The younger Pliny gives in one of his
            letters a pathetic account of the execution of Cornelia, a vestal
            virgin, by the order of Domitian. She was buried alive for
            incest; but her innocence appears to have been generally
            believed; and she had been condemned unheard, and in her absence.
            As she was being lowered into the subterranean cell her dress was
            caught and deranged in the descent. She turned round and drew it
            to her, and when the executioner stretched out his hand to assist
            her, she started back lest he should touch her, for this,
            according to the received opinion, was a pollution; and even in
            the supreme moment of her agony her vestal purity shrank from the
            unholy contact. (Plin. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Ep.</span></span> iv. 11.) If we now pass
            back several centuries, we find Euripides attributing to Polyxena
            a trait precisely similar to that which was attributed to
            Perpetua. As she fell beneath the sword of the executioner, it
            was observed that her last care was that she might fall with
            decency.</p>

          Spain) held in 1322, which anathematises laymen who compel their
          pastors to take concubines. (Lea, p. 324.) Sleidan mentions that it
          was customary in some of the Swiss cantons for the parishioners to
          oblige the priest to select a concubine as a necessary precaution
          for the protection of his female parishioners. (Ibid. p. 355.)

          mentions (on the authority of Zuinglius) this Swiss custom. Nicolas
          of Clemangis, a leading member of the Council of Constance,
          declared that this custom had become very common, that the laity
          were firmly persuaded that priests <em class=

          lived a life of real celibacy, and that, where no proofs of

          yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.”</span> (Proverbs
          xxxi. 20.) I have already quoted from Xenophon the beautiful
          description of the Greek wife tending her sick slaves. So, too,
          Euripides represents the slaves of Alcestis gathering with tears
          around the bed of their dying mistress, who, even then, found some
          kind word for each, and, when she died, lamenting her as their
          second mother. (Eurip. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          which desolated Sicily at the time of the Punic wars, we find a
          touching trait of the same kind. The revolt was provoked by the
          cruelties of a rich man, named Damophilus, and his wife, who were
          massacred with circumstances of great atrocity; but the slaves
          preserved their daughter entirely unharmed, for she had always made
          it her business to console them in their sorrow, and she had won
          the love of all. (Diodor. Sic. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Frag.</span></span>
          xxxiv.) So, too, Marcia, the wife of Cato, used to suckle her young
          slaves from her breast. (Plut. <span class=

          Cato</span></span>.) I may add the well-known sentiment which

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
